It cannot do anything at all, no words, no action, it is dependent and is a burden on its master. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَيْنَمَا يُوَجِّههُّ</div><p>(whichever way he directs him,) meaning, wherever he sends him </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ يَأْتِ بِخَيْرٍ</div><p>(he brings no good.) meaning, he does not succeed in what he wants. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَلْ يَسْتَوِى</div><p>(Is such a man equal) meaning, a man who has these attributes </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن يَأْمُرُ بِالْعَدْلِ</div><p>(to one who commands justice) meaning fairness, one whose words are true and whose deeds are righteous. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ عَلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ</div><p>(and is himself on the straight path) Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said: \"This is also an example of the disbeliever and the believer\", as in the previous Ayah. </p>"
