    "text": "<h2>The Jews know that the Prophet is True, but they hide the Truth</h2><p>Allah states that the scholars of the People of the Scripture know the truth of what Allah's Messenger ﷺ  was sent with, just as one of them knows his own child, which is a parable that the Arabs use to describe what is very apparent. Similarly, in a Hadith, Allah's Messenger ﷺ said to a man who had a youngster with him:</p><p>«ابْنُكَ هَذَا»</p><p>؟ قَالَ: نَعَمْ يَا رَسُولَ اللهِ أَشْهَدُ بِهِ</p><p>(Is this your son) He said, \"Yes, O Messenger of Allah ﷺ! I testify to this fact.\" Allah's Messenger ﷺ said:</p><p>«أَمَا إِنَّهُ لَا يَجْنِي عَلَيْكَ وَلَا تَجْنِي عَلَيْه»</p><p>(Well, you would not transgress against him nor would he transgress against you.)</p><p>According to Al-Qurtubi, it was narrated that `Umar said to `Abdullah bin Salam (an Israelite scholar who became a Muslim), \"Do you recognize Muhammad ﷺ as you recognize your own son\" He replied, \"Yes, and even more. The Honest One descended from heaven on the Honest One on the earth with his (i.e., Muhammad's) description and I recognized him, although I do not know anything about his mother's story.\"</p><p>Allah states next that although they had knowledge and certainty in the Prophet , they still:</p><p>لَيَكْتُمُونَ الْحَقَّ</p><p>(conceal the truth.)</p><p>The Ayah indicates that they hide the truth from the people, about the Prophet , that they find in their Books,</p><p>وَهُمْ يَعْلَمُونَ</p><p>(while they know it. ) Allah then strengthens the resolve of His Prophet and the believers and affirms that what the Prophet came with is the truth without doubt, saying:</p><p>الْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ فَلاَ تَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْمُمْتَرِينَ</p><p>((This is) the truth from your Lord. So be you not one of those who doubt.)</p>"
