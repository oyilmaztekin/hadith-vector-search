    "text": "<h2>The Reward of Those who desire this World and Those who desire the Hereafter</h2><p>Allah tells us that not everyone who desires this world and its luxuries gets what he wants. That is attained by those whom Allah wants to have it, and they get what He wills that they should get. This Ayah narrows down the general statements made in other Ayat. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَجَّلْنَا لَهُ فِيهَا مَا نَشَآءُ لِمَن نُّرِيدُ ثُمَّ جَعَلْنَا لَهُ جَهَنَّمَ</div><p>(We readily grant him what We will for whom We like. Then, afterwards, We have appointed for him Hell) meaning, in the Hereafter,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَصْلَـهَآ</div><p>(he will burn therein) means, he will enter it until it covers him on all sides,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَذْمُومًا</div><p>(disgraced) means, blamed for his bad behaviour and evil deeds, because he chose the transient over the eternal,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّدْحُورًا</div><p>(rejected.) means, far away (from Allah's mercy), humiliated and put to shame.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَنْ أَرَادَ الاٌّخِرَةَ</div><p>(And whoever desires the Hereafter) wanting the Hereafter and its blessings and delights,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَسَعَى لَهَا سَعْيَهَا</div><p>(and strives for it, with the necessary effort due for it) seeking it in the right way, which is following the Messenger .</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ</div><p>(while he is a believer,) means, his heart has faith, i.e., he believes in the reward and punishment,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأُولَـئِكَ كَانَ سَعْيُهُم مَّشْكُورًا</div><p>(then such are the ones whose striving shall be appreciated, (rewarded by Allah).)</p>"
