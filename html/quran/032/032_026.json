Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَمْشُونَ فِى مَسَـكِنِهِمْ</div><p>(in whose dwellings they do walk about) meaning, these disbelievers walk about in the places where those disbelievers used to live, but they do not see any of those who used to live there, for they have gone --</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَأَن لَّمْ يَغْنَوْاْ فِيهَآ</div><p>(As if they had never lived there) (11:68) This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَتِلْكَ بُيُوتُهُمْ خَاوِيَةً بِمَا ظَلَمُواْ</div><p>(These are their houses in utter ruin, for they did wrong) (27:52).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَأَيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ أَهْلَكْنَـهَا وَهِىَ ظَالِمَةٌ فَهِىَ خَاوِيَةٌ عَلَى عُرُوشِهَا وَبِئْرٍ مُّعَطَّلَةٍ وَقَصْرٍ مَّشِيدٍ أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ</div><p>(And many a township did We destroy while they were given to wrongdoing, so that it lie in ruins, and (many) a deserted well and lofty castle! Have they not traveled through the land) until:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَـكِن تَعْمَى الْقُلُوبُ الَّتِى فِى الصُّدُورِ</div><p>(but it is the hearts which are in the breasts that grow blind.) (22:45-46) Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ لاّيَاتٍ</div><p>(Verily, therein indeed are signs.) meaning, in the fact that these people are gone and have been destroyed, and in what happened to them because they disbelieved the Messengers, and how those who believed in them were saved, there are many signs, proofs and important lessons.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَلاَ يَسْمَعُونَ</div><p>(Would they not then listen) means, to the stories of those who came before and what happened to them. n</p><h2>The Revival of the Earth with Water is Proof of the Resurrection to come</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّا نَسُوقُ الْمَآءَ إِلَى الاٌّرْضِ الْجُرُزِ</div><p>(Have they not seen how We drive water to the dry land) Here Allah explains His kindness and goodness towards them by His sending water to them, whether from the sky or from water flowing through the land, water carried by rivers down from the mountains to the lands that need it at particular times. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلَى الاٌّرْضِ الْجُرُزِ</div><p>(to the dry land) which means the land where nothing grows, as in the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّا لَجَاعِلُونَ مَا عَلَيْهَا صَعِيداً جُرُزاً </div><p>(And verily, We shall make all that is on it a bare dry soil.) (18:8) i.e., barren land where nothing grows. Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّا نَسُوقُ الْمَآءَ إِلَى الاٌّرْضِ الْجُرُزِ فَنُخْرِجُ بِهِ زَرْعاً تَأْكُلُ مِنْهُ أَنْعَـمُهُمْ وَأَنفُسُهُمْ أَفَلاَ يُبْصِرُونَ </div><p>(Have they not seen how We drive water to the dry land that has no vegetation, and therewith bring forth crops providing food for their cattle and themselves Will they not then see) This is like the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلْيَنظُرِ الإِنسَـنُ إِلَى طَعَامِهِ أَنَّا صَبَبْنَا الْمَآءَ صَبّاً </div><p>(Then let man look at his food: We pour forth water in abundance.)
