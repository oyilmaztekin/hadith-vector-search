The Prophet said,\n«فَبَيْنَا أَنَا أَمْشِي إِذْ سَمِعْتُ صَوْتًا مِنَ السَّمَاءِ فَرَفَعْتُ بَصَرِي قِبَلَ السَّمَاءِ، فَإِذَا الْمَلَكُ الَّذِي جَاءَنِي بِحِرَاءَ، قَاعِدٌ عَلَى كُرْسِيَ بَيْنَ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ، فَجُئِثْتُ مِنْهُ حَتْى هَوَيْتُ إِلَى الْأَرْضِ، فَجِئْتُ إِلَى أَهْلِي فَقُلْتُ: زَمِّلُونِي زَمِّلُونِي فَزَمَّلُونِي. فَأَنْزَلَ (اللهُ تَعَالى):\nيأَيُّهَا الْمُدَّثِّرُ - قُمْ فَأَنذِرْ\nفَاهْجُرْ\nثُمَّ حَمِيَ الْوَحْيُ وَتَتَابَع»\n(While I was walking I heard a voice from the sky.

This is the wording of Al-Bukhari. The way this Hadith is narrated necessitates that revelation had descended before this.

The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«كَيْفَ أَنْعَمُ وَصَاحِبُ الْقَرْنِ قَدِ الْتَقَمَ الْقَرْنَ وَحَنَى جَبْهَتَهُ يَنْتَظِرُ مَتَى يُؤْمَرُ فَيَنْفُخُ؟»\n(How can I be comfortable when the one with the horn has placed it in his mouth, leaned his forehead forward, and is waiting to be commanded so that he can blow) The Companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, \"What do you command us, O Messenger of Allah\" He replied,\n«قُولُوا: حَسْبُنَا اللهُ وَنِعْمَ الْوَكِيلُ، عَلَى اللهِ تَوَكَّلْنَا»\n(Say: \"Allah is sufficient for us, and what an excellent Trustee He is.

So I lifted my gaze towards the sky and saw the same angel who had come to me at the cave of Hira'. He was sitting on a chair between the sky and the earth. So I fled from him (in fear) until I fell down to the ground. Then, I went to my family and I said, `Wrap me up, wrap me up. So, they wrapped me up! So Allah revealed, (O you wrapped up! Arise and warn!) until (And keep away) Here, Abu Salamah added, `Ar-Rujz means idols.' (After this, the revelation started coming strongly and frequently in succession.) This is the wording of Al-Bukhari. The way this Hadith is narrated necessitates that revelation had descended before this. This is due to the Prophet's statement,\n«فَإِذَا الْمَلَكُ الَّذِي جَاءَنِي بِحِرَاء»\n(The same angel who had come to me at the cave of Hira'.)\" That angel was Jibril, who had came to him with Allah's statement,\nاقْرَأْ بِاسْمِ رَبِّكَ الَّذِى خَلَقَ - خَلَقَ الإِنسَـنَ مِنْ عَلَقٍ - اقْرَأْ وَرَبُّكَ الاٌّكْرَمُ - الَّذِى عَلَّمَ بِالْقَلَمِ - عَلَّمَ الإِنسَـنَ مَا لَمْ يَعْلَمْ\n(Read! In the Name of your Lord Who has created. He has created man from a clot. Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous. Who has taught by the pen. He has taught man that which he knew not.) (96:1-5) After this first occurrence (in the cave) there was a period of time that passed, then the angel descended again. Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Salamah bin `Abdur-Rahman that Jabir bin `Abdullah informed him that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saying,\n«ثُمَّ فَتَرَ الْوَحْيُ عَنِّي فَتْرَةً، فَبَيْنَا أَنَا أَمْشِي سَمِعْتُ صَوْتًا مِنَ السَّمَاءِ، فَرَفَعْتُ بَصَرِي قِبَلَ السَّمَاءِ، فَإِذَا الْمَلَكُ الَّذِي جَاءَنِي، قَاعِدٌ عَلى كُرْسِيَ بَيْنَ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ، فَجُئِثْتُ مِنْهُ فَرَقًا حَتْى هَوَيْتُ إِلَى الْأَرْضِ، فَجِئْتُ أَهْلِي فَقُلْتُ لَهُمْ: زَمِّلُونِي زَمِّلُونِي فَزَمَّلُونِي، فَأَنْزَلَ اللهُ تَعَالى:\nيأَيُّهَا الْمُدَّثِّرُ - قُمْ فَأَنذِرْ - وَرَبَّكَ فَكَبِّرْ - وَثِيَابَكَ فَطَهِّرْ - وَالرُّجْزَ فَاهْجُرْ\nثُمَّ حَمِيَ الْوَحْيُ وَتَتَابَع»\n(Then the revelation ceased coming to me for a period of time.Then, while I was walking, I heard a voice from the sky. So I lifted my gaze towards the sky to see the same angel who had come to me, sitting on a chair between the sky and the earth. So I fled from him a short distance before I fell down to the ground. Then I came to my family and said to them, `Wrap me up, wrap me up! So, they wrapped me up! Then Allah revealed, (O you wrapped up! Arise and warn! And magnify your Lord. And purify your garments. And keep away from Ar-Rujz!)( After this, the revelation started coming strongly and frequently in succession.) They both (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) recorded this Hadith by way of Az-Zuhri. At-Tabarani recorded from Ibn `Abbas that he said, \"Verily, Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah prepared some food for the Quraysh. So when they had eaten from it he said, `What do you have to say about this man' Some of them said, `He is a magician.' Others said, `He is not a magician.' Then some of them said, `He is a soothsayer.' But others said, `He is not a soothsayer.' Some of them said, `He is a poet.' But others said, `He is not a poet.' Some of them said, `This is magic from that of old.' Thus, they eventually all agreed that it was magic from ancient times. Then, when this news reached the Prophet , he became grieved, covered his head and wrapped himself up. This is when Allah revealed,\nيأَيُّهَا الْمُدَّثِّرُ - قُمْ فَأَنذِرْ - وَرَبَّكَ فَكَبِّرْ - وَثِيَابَكَ فَطَهِّرْ - وَالرُّجْزَ فَاهْجُرْ - وَلاَ تَمْنُن تَسْتَكْثِرُ - وَلِرَبِّكَ فَاصْبِرْ\n(O you enveloped in garments!

(96:1-5) After this first occurrence (in the cave) there was a period of time that passed, then the angel descended again. Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Salamah bin `Abdur-Rahman that Jabir bin `Abdullah informed him that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saying,\n«ثُمَّ فَتَرَ الْوَحْيُ عَنِّي فَتْرَةً، فَبَيْنَا أَنَا أَمْشِي سَمِعْتُ صَوْتًا مِنَ السَّمَاءِ، فَرَفَعْتُ بَصَرِي قِبَلَ السَّمَاءِ، فَإِذَا الْمَلَكُ الَّذِي جَاءَنِي، قَاعِدٌ عَلى كُرْسِيَ بَيْنَ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ، فَجُئِثْتُ مِنْهُ فَرَقًا حَتْى هَوَيْتُ إِلَى الْأَرْضِ، فَجِئْتُ أَهْلِي فَقُلْتُ لَهُمْ: زَمِّلُونِي زَمِّلُونِي فَزَمَّلُونِي، فَأَنْزَلَ اللهُ تَعَالى:\nيأَيُّهَا الْمُدَّثِّرُ - قُمْ فَأَنذِرْ - وَرَبَّكَ فَكَبِّرْ - وَثِيَابَكَ فَطَهِّرْ - وَالرُّجْزَ فَاهْجُرْ\nثُمَّ حَمِيَ الْوَحْيُ وَتَتَابَع»\n(Then the revelation ceased coming to me for a period of time.Then, while I was walking, I heard a voice from the sky. So I lifted my gaze towards the sky to see the same angel who had come to me, sitting on a chair between the sky and the earth. So I fled from him a short distance before I fell down to the ground. Then I came to my family and said to them, `Wrap me up, wrap me up! So, they wrapped me up! Then Allah revealed, (O you wrapped up! Arise and warn! And magnify your Lord. And purify your garments. And keep away from Ar-Rujz!)( After this, the revelation started coming strongly and frequently in succession.) They both (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) recorded this Hadith by way of Az-Zuhri. At-Tabarani recorded from Ibn `Abbas that he said, \"Verily, Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah prepared some food for the Quraysh. So when they had eaten from it he said, `What do you have to say about this man' Some of them said, `He is a magician.' Others said, `He is not a magician.' Then some of them said, `He is a soothsayer.' But others said, `He is not a soothsayer.' Some of them said, `He is a poet.' But others said, `He is not a poet.' Some of them said, `This is magic from that of old.' Thus, they eventually all agreed that it was magic from ancient times. Then, when this news reached the Prophet , he became grieved, covered his head and wrapped himself up. This is when Allah revealed,\nيأَيُّهَا الْمُدَّثِّرُ - قُمْ فَأَنذِرْ - وَرَبَّكَ فَكَبِّرْ - وَثِيَابَكَ فَطَهِّرْ - وَالرُّجْزَ فَاهْجُرْ - وَلاَ تَمْنُن تَسْتَكْثِرُ - وَلِرَبِّكَ فَاصْبِرْ\n(O you enveloped in garments!

Concerning Allah's statement,\nقُمْ فَأَنذِرْ\n(Arise and warn!) means, prepare to go forth with zeal and warn the people. With this the Prophet attained messengership just as he attained prophethood with the first revelation.\nوَرَبَّكَ فَكَبِّرْ\n(And magnify your Lord!) to declare the greatness of Him. Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas;\nوَثِيَابَكَ فَطَهِّرْ\n(And purify your garments!) \"This means, do not let your garments that you wear be from earnings that are unlawful.\" It has also been said, \"Do not wear your clothes in disobedience.\" Muhammad bin Sirin said,\nوَثِيَابَكَ فَطَهِّرْ\n(And purify your garments!) \"This means clean them with water.\" Ibn Zayd said, \"The idolators would not clean themselves, so Allah commanded him to clean himself and his garments.\" This view was preferred by Ibn Jarir.

The Prophet said,\n«فَبَيْنَا أَنَا أَمْشِي إِذْ سَمِعْتُ صَوْتًا مِنَ السَّمَاءِ فَرَفَعْتُ بَصَرِي قِبَلَ السَّمَاءِ، فَإِذَا الْمَلَكُ الَّذِي جَاءَنِي بِحِرَاءَ، قَاعِدٌ عَلَى كُرْسِيَ بَيْنَ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ، فَجُئِثْتُ مِنْهُ حَتْى هَوَيْتُ إِلَى الْأَرْضِ، فَجِئْتُ إِلَى أَهْلِي فَقُلْتُ: زَمِّلُونِي زَمِّلُونِي فَزَمَّلُونِي. فَأَنْزَلَ (اللهُ تَعَالى):\nيأَيُّهَا الْمُدَّثِّرُ - قُمْ فَأَنذِرْ\nفَاهْجُرْ\nثُمَّ حَمِيَ الْوَحْيُ وَتَتَابَع»\n(While I was walking I heard a voice from the sky.

This is the wording of Al-Bukhari. The way this Hadith is narrated necessitates that revelation had descended before this.

The Prophet said,\n«فَبَيْنَا أَنَا أَمْشِي إِذْ سَمِعْتُ صَوْتًا مِنَ السَّمَاءِ فَرَفَعْتُ بَصَرِي قِبَلَ السَّمَاءِ، فَإِذَا الْمَلَكُ الَّذِي جَاءَنِي بِحِرَاءَ، قَاعِدٌ عَلَى كُرْسِيَ بَيْنَ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ، فَجُئِثْتُ مِنْهُ حَتْى هَوَيْتُ إِلَى الْأَرْضِ، فَجِئْتُ إِلَى أَهْلِي فَقُلْتُ: زَمِّلُونِي زَمِّلُونِي فَزَمَّلُونِي. فَأَنْزَلَ (اللهُ تَعَالى):\nيأَيُّهَا الْمُدَّثِّرُ - قُمْ فَأَنذِرْ\nفَاهْجُرْ\nثُمَّ حَمِيَ الْوَحْيُ وَتَتَابَع»\n(While I was walking I heard a voice from the sky. So I lifted my gaze towards the sky and saw the same angel who had come to me at the cave of Hira'. He was sitting on a chair between the sky and the earth. So I fled from him (in fear) until I fell down to the ground. Then, I went to my family and I said, `Wrap me up, wrap me up. So, they wrapped me up! So Allah revealed, (O you wrapped up! Arise and warn!) until (And keep away) Here, Abu Salamah added, `Ar-Rujz means idols.' (After this, the revelation started coming strongly and frequently in succession.) This is the wording of Al-Bukhari. The way this Hadith is narrated necessitates that revelation had descended before this. This is due to the Prophet's statement,\n«فَإِذَا الْمَلَكُ الَّذِي جَاءَنِي بِحِرَاء»\n(The same angel who had come to me at the cave of Hira'.)\" That angel was Jibril, who had came to him with Allah's statement,\nاقْرَأْ بِاسْمِ رَبِّكَ الَّذِى خَلَقَ - خَلَقَ الإِنسَـنَ مِنْ عَلَقٍ - اقْرَأْ وَرَبُّكَ الاٌّكْرَمُ - الَّذِى عَلَّمَ بِالْقَلَمِ - عَلَّمَ الإِنسَـنَ مَا لَمْ يَعْلَمْ\n(Read! In the Name of your Lord Who has created. He has created man from a clot. Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous. Who has taught by the pen. He has taught man that which he knew not.) (96:1-5) After this first occurrence (in the cave) there was a period of time that passed, then the angel descended again. Imam Ahmad recorded from Abu Salamah bin `Abdur-Rahman that Jabir bin `Abdullah informed him that he heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saying,\n«ثُمَّ فَتَرَ الْوَحْيُ عَنِّي فَتْرَةً، فَبَيْنَا أَنَا أَمْشِي سَمِعْتُ صَوْتًا مِنَ السَّمَاءِ، فَرَفَعْتُ بَصَرِي قِبَلَ السَّمَاءِ، فَإِذَا الْمَلَكُ الَّذِي جَاءَنِي، قَاعِدٌ عَلى كُرْسِيَ بَيْنَ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ، فَجُئِثْتُ مِنْهُ فَرَقًا حَتْى هَوَيْتُ إِلَى الْأَرْضِ، فَجِئْتُ أَهْلِي فَقُلْتُ لَهُمْ: زَمِّلُونِي زَمِّلُونِي فَزَمَّلُونِي، فَأَنْزَلَ اللهُ تَعَالى:\nيأَيُّهَا الْمُدَّثِّرُ - قُمْ فَأَنذِرْ - وَرَبَّكَ فَكَبِّرْ - وَثِيَابَكَ فَطَهِّرْ - وَالرُّجْزَ فَاهْجُرْ\nثُمَّ حَمِيَ الْوَحْيُ وَتَتَابَع»\n(Then the revelation ceased coming to me for a period of time.Then, while I was walking, I heard a voice from the sky. So I lifted my gaze towards the sky to see the same angel who had come to me, sitting on a chair between the sky and the earth. So I fled from him a short distance before I fell down to the ground. Then I came to my family and said to them, `Wrap me up, wrap me up! So, they wrapped me up! Then Allah revealed, (O you wrapped up! Arise and warn! And magnify your Lord. And purify your garments. And keep away from Ar-Rujz!)( After this, the revelation started coming strongly and frequently in succession.) They both (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) recorded this Hadith by way of Az-Zuhri. At-Tabarani recorded from Ibn `Abbas that he said, \"Verily, Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah prepared some food for the Quraysh. So when they had eaten from it he said, `What do you have to say about this man' Some of them said, `He is a magician.' Others said, `He is not a magician.' Then some of them said, `He is a soothsayer.' But others said, `He is not a soothsayer.' Some of them said, `He is a poet.' But others said, `He is not a poet.' Some of them said, `This is magic from that of old.' Thus, they eventually all agreed that it was magic from ancient times. Then, when this news reached the Prophet , he became grieved, covered his head and wrapped himself up. This is when Allah revealed,\nيأَيُّهَا الْمُدَّثِّرُ - قُمْ فَأَنذِرْ - وَرَبَّكَ فَكَبِّرْ - وَثِيَابَكَ فَطَهِّرْ - وَالرُّجْزَ فَاهْجُرْ - وَلاَ تَمْنُن تَسْتَكْثِرُ - وَلِرَبِّكَ فَاصْبِرْ\n(O you enveloped in garments! Arise and warn! And magnify your Lord (Allah)! And purify your garments! And keep away from Ar-Rujz (the idols)! And give not a thing in order to have more (or consider not your deeds of obedience to Allah as a favour to Him). And be patient for the sake of your Lord (i.e., perform your duty to Allah)!) Concerning Allah's statement,\nقُمْ فَأَنذِرْ\n(Arise and warn!) means, prepare to go forth with zeal and warn the people. With this the Prophet attained messengership just as he attained prophethood with the first revelation.\nوَرَبَّكَ فَكَبِّرْ\n(And magnify your Lord!) to declare the greatness of Him. Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas;\nوَثِيَابَكَ فَطَهِّرْ\n(And purify your garments!) \"This means, do not let your garments that you wear be from earnings that are unlawful.\" It has also been said, \"Do not wear your clothes in disobedience.\" Muhammad bin Sirin said,\nوَثِيَابَكَ فَطَهِّرْ\n(And purify your garments!) \"This means clean them with water.\" Ibn Zayd said, \"The idolators would not clean themselves, so Allah commanded him to clean himself and his garments.\" This view was preferred by Ibn Jarir. Sa`id bin Jubayr said,\nوَثِيَابَكَ فَطَهِّرْ\n(And purify your garments!) \"This means purify your heart and your intentions.\" Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi and Al-Hasan Al-Basri both said, \"And beautify your character.\" Concerning Allah's statement,\nوَالرُّجْزَ فَاهْجُرْ\n(And keep away from Ar-Rujz!) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas, \"Ar-Rujz are idols, so keep away from them.\" Similar to this was said by Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah, Az-Zuhri and Ibn Zayd, \"Verily, it is the idols.\" This is like Allah's statement,\nيأَيُّهَا النَّبِىِّ اتَّقِ اللَّهَ وَلاَ تُطِعِ الْكَـفِرِينَ وَالْمُنَـفِقِينَ\n(O Prophet! have Taqwa of Allah, and obey not the disbelievers and the hypocrites.) (33:1) and Allah's statement,\nوَقَالَ مُوسَى لاًّخِيهِ هَـرُونَ اخْلُفْنِى فِى قَوْمِى وَأَصْلِحْ وَلاَ تَتَّبِعْ سَبِيلَ الْمُفْسِدِينَ\n(And Musa said to his brother Harun: \"Replace me among my people, act well and follow not way of the corrupters.\") (7:142) Then Allah says,\nوَلاَ تَمْنُن تَسْتَكْثِرُ\n(And give not a thing in order to have more.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"Do not give any gift seeking to get (back in return) more than it.\" Khusayf reported from Mujahid;\nوَلاَ تَمْنُن تَسْتَكْثِرُ\n(And give not a thing (Tamnun) in order to have more.) \"Do not slacken in seeking more good. Tamnun in the language of the Arabs means to become weak.\" Concerning Allah's statement,\nوَلِرَبِّكَ فَاصْبِرْ\n(And be patient for the sake of your Lord!) meaning, make your patience with their harms be for the Face of your Lord, the Mighty and Majestic. This was stated by Mujahid. Ibrahim An-Nakha`i said, \"Be patient in your giving for the sake of Allah, the Mighty and Majestic.\"\nReminding of the Day of Judgement\nConcerning Allah's statement,\nفَإِذَا نُقِرَ فِى النَّاقُورِ - فَذَلِكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ يَوْمٌ عَسِيرٌ - عَلَى الْكَـفِرِينَ غَيْرُ يَسِيرٍ\n(Then, when the Naqur is sounded. Truly, that Day will be a Hard Day -- far from easy for the disbelievers) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi, Zayd bin Aslam, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd, all said,\nالنَّاقُورِ\n(Naqur) \"It is the Trumpet.\" Mujahid said, \"It is in the shape of a horn.\" Ibn Abi Hatim narrated that Abu Sa`id Al-Ashaj told them that Asbat bin Muhammad related to them from Mutarrif, from `Atiyah Al-`Awfi, from Ibn `Abbas,\nفَإِذَا نُقِرَ فِى النَّاقُورِ\n(Then, when the Trumpet is sounded.) The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«كَيْفَ أَنْعَمُ وَصَاحِبُ الْقَرْنِ قَدِ الْتَقَمَ الْقَرْنَ وَحَنَى جَبْهَتَهُ يَنْتَظِرُ مَتَى يُؤْمَرُ فَيَنْفُخُ؟»\n(How can I be comfortable when the one with the horn has placed it in his mouth, leaned his forehead forward, and is waiting to be commanded so that he can blow) The Companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, \"What do you command us, O Messenger of Allah\" He replied,\n«قُولُوا: حَسْبُنَا اللهُ وَنِعْمَ الْوَكِيلُ، عَلَى اللهِ تَوَكَّلْنَا»\n(Say: \"Allah is sufficient for us, and what an excellent Trustee He is. We put our trust in Allah.\") It has been recorded like this by Imam Ahmad on the authority of Asbat. Concerning Allah's statement,\nفَذَلِكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ يَوْمٌ عَسِيرٌ\n(Truly, that Day will be a Hard Day.) meaning, severe.\nعَلَى الْكَـفِرِينَ غَيْرُ يَسِيرٍ\n(Far from easy for the disbelievers.) meaning, it will not be easy for them. This is as Allah says,\nيَقُولُ الْكَـفِرُونَ هَـذَا يَوْمٌ عَسِرٌ\n(The disbelievers will say: \"This a Hard Day.\") (54:8) We have reported from Zurarah bin Awfa, the judge of Al-Basrah, that he lead the people in the morning prayer and he recited this Surah. Then, when he reached Allah's statement,\nفَإِذَا نُقِرَ فِى النَّاقُورِ - فَذَلِكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ يَوْمٌ عَسِيرٌ - عَلَى الْكَـفِرِينَ غَيْرُ يَسِيرٍ\n(Then, when the Naqur is sounded. Truly, that Day will be a Hard Day -- far from easy for the disbelievers.) he made a moaning sound and then he fell down dead.

Allah recounts to him His favors upon him when He says,\nذَرْنِى وَمَنْ خَلَقْتُ وَحِيداً \n(Leave Me alone (to deal) with whom I created lonely.) meaning, he came out of the womb of his mother alone, without any wealth or children. Then, Allah provided him with\nمَالاً مَّمْدُوداً\n(resources in abundance.) meaning, vast and abundant. Allah then made for him,\nوَبَنِينَ شُهُوداً \n(And children attending.) Mujahid said, \"They are not absent.\" This means that they are present with him. They do not travel for business and trade. Rather, their servants and hired workers handle all of that for them while they are sitting with their father. He enjoys their company and delights in being with them.\nوَمَهَّدتُّ لَهُ تَمْهِيداً \n(And made life smooth and comfortable for him.) meaning, `I made possible for him to amass wealth, luxuries and other than that.'\nثُمَّ يَطْمَعُ أَنْ أَزِيدَ - كَلاَّ إِنَّهُ كان لاٌّيَـتِنَا عَنِيداً \n(After all that he desires that I should give more.

Allah says,\nسَأُرْهِقُهُ صَعُوداً \n(I shall force him to Sa`ud!) Qatadah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, \"Sa`ud is a rock in Hell that the disbeliever will be dragged across on his face.\" As-Suddi said, \"Sa`ud is a slippery rock in Hell that he will be forced to climb.\" Mujahid said,\nسَأُرْهِقُهُ صَعُوداً \n(I shall force him to Sa`ud!) \"This is a harsh portion of the torment.\" Qatadah said, \"It is a torment that contains no relaxation (break for relief).\" Concerning Allah's statement,\nإِنَّهُ فَكَّرَ وَقَدَّرَ \n(Verily, he thought and plotted.) meaning, `We only caused him to face the grievous torment of Sa`ud, that is Our bringing him close to the harsh torment, because he was far away from faith.' This was because he thought and plotted, meaning he contemplated what he should say about the Qur'an when he was asked about it. So he deliberated over what statement he should invent against it.\nوَقَدَّرَ\n(and plotted.) meaning, he contemplated.\nفَقُتِلَ كَيْفَ قَدَّرَ - ثُمَّ قُتِلَ كَيْفَ قَدَّرَ \n(So let him be cursed, how he plotted! And once more let him be cursed, how he plotted!) This is a supplication against him.\nثُمَّ نَظَرَ \n(Then he thought.) meaning, he thought again and deliberated.\nثُمَّ عَبَسَ\n(Then he frowned) meaning, he contracted his eyebrows together and frowned.\nوَبَسَرَ\n(and he looked in a bad tempered way.) meaning, he scowled and was disgusted. Concerning Allah's statement,\nثُمَّ أَدْبَرَ وَاسْتَكْبَرَ \n(Then he turned back, and was proud.) meaning, he turned away from the truth and arrogantly refused to accept and submit to the Qur'an.\nفَقَالَ إِنْ هَـذَآ إِلاَّ سِحْرٌ يُؤْثَرُ \n(Then he said: \"This is nothing but magic from that of old.\") meaning, `this is magic that Muhammad received from those who were before him, and he is merely saying what he got from them.' This is why he said,\nإِنْ هَـذَآ إِلاَّ قَوْلُ الْبَشَرِ \n(This is nothing but the word of a human being!) meaning, it is not the Words of Allah. The person who is mentioned in this discussion is Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah Al-Makhzumi. He was one of the chiefs of the Quraysh -- may Allah curse him. Among the narrations about this is what was reported by Al-`Awfi from Ibn `Abbas. He (Ibn `Abbas) said, \"Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah entered the house of Abu Bakr bin Abi Quhafah and asked him about the Qur'an. When Abu Bakr informed him about it, he left and went to the Quraysh saying, `What a great thing this is that Ibn Abi Kabshah is saying. I swear by Allah that it is not poetry, nor magic, nor the prattling of insanity. Verily, his speech is from the Words of Allah!' So when a group of the Quraysh heard this they gathered and said, `By Allah, if Al-Walid converts (to Islam) all of the Quraysh will convert.' When Abu Jahl bin Hisham heard this he said, `By Allah, I will deal with him for you.' So he went to Al-Walid's house and entered upon him. He said to Al-Walid, `Don't you see that your people are collecting charity for you' Al-Walid replied, `Don't I have more wealth and children than they do' Abu Jahl answered, `They are saying that you only went to Ibn Abi Quhafah's house so that you can get some of his food.' Al-Walid then said, `Is this what my tribe is saying Nay, by Allah, I am not seeking to be close to Ibn Abi Quhafah, nor `Umar, nor Ibn Abi Kabshah. And his speech is only inherited magic of old.' So Allah revealed to His Messenger ,\nذَرْنِى وَمَنْ خَلَقْتُ وَحِيداً \n(Leave me alone with whom I created lonely.) until His statement,\nلاَ تُبْقِى وَلاَ تَذَرُ \n(It spares not, nor does it leave (anything)!)\" Qatadah said, \"They claim that he (Al-Walid) said, `By Allah, I thought about what the man says, and it is not poetry. Verily, it has a sweetness and it is truly elegant. Verily, it is exalted and it is not overcome. And I have no doubt that it is magic.' So Allah revealed,\nفَقُتِلَ كَيْفَ قَدَّرَ \n(So let him be cursed, how he plotted!)\nثُمَّ عَبَسَ وَبَسَرَ \n(Then he frowned and he looked in a bad tempered way.) He contracted his eyes together and scowled.\" Allah says,\nسَأُصْلِيهِ سَقَرَ \n(I will cast him into Saqar.) meaning, `I will engulf him in it from all his sides.' Then Allah says,\nوَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا سَقَرُ \n(And what will make you know (exactly) what Saqar is) This is to give fright and emphasis to its matter. Then Allah explains this by His saying,\n   لَا تُبْقِي وَلَا تَذَرُ        \n(It spares not, nor does it leave (anything)!) meaning, it eats their flesh, veins, nerves and their skins. Then their organs will be changed into something else. They will remain in this (form), not living or dying. This was stated by Ibn Buraydah, Abu Sinan and others. Concerning Allah's statement,\nلَوَّاحَةٌ لِّلْبَشَرِ \n(Scorching for the humans!) Mujahid said, \"This means for the skin.\" Qatadah said,\nلَوَّاحَةٌ لِّلْبَشَرِ \n(Scorching for the humans!) \"This means burning the skin.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"Burning the skin of man.\" Concerning Allah's statement,\nعَلَيْهَا تِسْعَةَ عَشَرَ \n(Over it are nineteen.) meaning, the first of the guardians of Hell.

He (Ibn `Abbas) said, \"Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah entered the house of Abu Bakr bin Abi Quhafah and asked him about the Qur'an.

I swear by Allah that it is not poetry, nor magic, nor the prattling of insanity. Verily, his speech is from the Words of Allah!' So when a group of the Quraysh heard this they gathered and said, `By Allah, if Al-Walid converts (to Islam) all of the Quraysh will convert.' When Abu Jahl bin Hisham heard this he said, `By Allah, I will deal with him for you.' So he went to Al-Walid's house and entered upon him. He said to Al-Walid, `Don't you see that your people are collecting charity for you' Al-Walid replied, `Don't I have more wealth and children than they do' Abu Jahl answered, `They are saying that you only went to Ibn Abi Quhafah's house so that you can get some of his food.' Al-Walid then said, `Is this what my tribe is saying Nay, by Allah, I am not seeking to be close to Ibn Abi Quhafah, nor `Umar, nor Ibn Abi Kabshah. And his speech is only inherited magic of old.' So Allah revealed to His Messenger ,\nذَرْنِى وَمَنْ خَلَقْتُ وَحِيداً \n(Leave me alone with whom I created lonely.) until His statement,\nلاَ تُبْقِى وَلاَ تَذَرُ \n(It spares not, nor does it leave (anything)!)\" Qatadah said, \"They claim that he (Al-Walid) said, `By Allah, I thought about what the man says, and it is not poetry.

Among the narrations about this is what was reported by Al-`Awfi from Ibn `Abbas. He (Ibn `Abbas) said, \"Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah entered the house of Abu Bakr bin Abi Quhafah and asked him about the Qur'an. When Abu Bakr informed him about it, he left and went to the Quraysh saying, `What a great thing this is that Ibn Abi Kabshah is saying. I swear by Allah that it is not poetry, nor magic, nor the prattling of insanity. Verily, his speech is from the Words of Allah!' So when a group of the Quraysh heard this they gathered and said, `By Allah, if Al-Walid converts (to Islam) all of the Quraysh will convert.' When Abu Jahl bin Hisham heard this he said, `By Allah, I will deal with him for you.' So he went to Al-Walid's house and entered upon him. He said to Al-Walid, `Don't you see that your people are collecting charity for you' Al-Walid replied, `Don't I have more wealth and children than they do' Abu Jahl answered, `They are saying that you only went to Ibn Abi Quhafah's house so that you can get some of his food.' Al-Walid then said, `Is this what my tribe is saying Nay, by Allah, I am not seeking to be close to Ibn Abi Quhafah, nor `Umar, nor Ibn Abi Kabshah. And his speech is only inherited magic of old.' So Allah revealed to His Messenger ,\nذَرْنِى وَمَنْ خَلَقْتُ وَحِيداً \n(Leave me alone with whom I created lonely.) until His statement,\nلاَ تُبْقِى وَلاَ تَذَرُ \n(It spares not, nor does it leave (anything)!)\" Qatadah said, \"They claim that he (Al-Walid) said, `By Allah, I thought about what the man says, and it is not poetry.

Among the narrations about this is what was reported by Al-`Awfi from Ibn `Abbas. He (Ibn `Abbas) said, \"Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah entered the house of Abu Bakr bin Abi Quhafah and asked him about the Qur'an. When Abu Bakr informed him about it, he left and went to the Quraysh saying, `What a great thing this is that Ibn Abi Kabshah is saying. I swear by Allah that it is not poetry, nor magic, nor the prattling of insanity. Verily, his speech is from the Words of Allah!' So when a group of the Quraysh heard this they gathered and said, `By Allah, if Al-Walid converts (to Islam) all of the Quraysh will convert.' When Abu Jahl bin Hisham heard this he said, `By Allah, I will deal with him for you.' So he went to Al-Walid's house and entered upon him. He said to Al-Walid, `Don't you see that your people are collecting charity for you' Al-Walid replied, `Don't I have more wealth and children than they do' Abu Jahl answered, `They are saying that you only went to Ibn Abi Quhafah's house so that you can get some of his food.' Al-Walid then said, `Is this what my tribe is saying Nay, by Allah, I am not seeking to be close to Ibn Abi Quhafah, nor `Umar, nor Ibn Abi Kabshah. And his speech is only inherited magic of old.' So Allah revealed to His Messenger ,\nذَرْنِى وَمَنْ خَلَقْتُ وَحِيداً \n(Leave me alone with whom I created lonely.) until His statement,\nلاَ تُبْقِى وَلاَ تَذَرُ \n(It spares not, nor does it leave (anything)!)\" Qatadah said, \"They claim that he (Al-Walid) said, `By Allah, I thought about what the man says, and it is not poetry.

He (Ibn `Abbas) said, \"Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah entered the house of Abu Bakr bin Abi Quhafah and asked him about the Qur'an. When Abu Bakr informed him about it, he left and went to the Quraysh saying, `What a great thing this is that Ibn Abi Kabshah is saying. I swear by Allah that it is not poetry, nor magic, nor the prattling of insanity. Verily, his speech is from the Words of Allah!' So when a group of the Quraysh heard this they gathered and said, `By Allah, if Al-Walid converts (to Islam) all of the Quraysh will convert.' When Abu Jahl bin Hisham heard this he said, `By Allah, I will deal with him for you.' So he went to Al-Walid's house and entered upon him. He said to Al-Walid, `Don't you see that your people are collecting charity for you' Al-Walid replied, `Don't I have more wealth and children than they do' Abu Jahl answered, `They are saying that you only went to Ibn Abi Quhafah's house so that you can get some of his food.' Al-Walid then said, `Is this what my tribe is saying Nay, by Allah, I am not seeking to be close to Ibn Abi Quhafah, nor `Umar, nor Ibn Abi Kabshah. And his speech is only inherited magic of old.' So Allah revealed to His Messenger ,\nذَرْنِى وَمَنْ خَلَقْتُ وَحِيداً \n(Leave me alone with whom I created lonely.) until His statement,\nلاَ تُبْقِى وَلاَ تَذَرُ \n(It spares not, nor does it leave (anything)!)\" Qatadah said, \"They claim that he (Al-Walid) said, `By Allah, I thought about what the man says, and it is not poetry.

He (Ibn `Abbas) said, \"Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah entered the house of Abu Bakr bin Abi Quhafah and asked him about the Qur'an. When Abu Bakr informed him about it, he left and went to the Quraysh saying, `What a great thing this is that Ibn Abi Kabshah is saying. I swear by Allah that it is not poetry, nor magic, nor the prattling of insanity. Verily, his speech is from the Words of Allah!' So when a group of the Quraysh heard this they gathered and said, `By Allah, if Al-Walid converts (to Islam) all of the Quraysh will convert.' When Abu Jahl bin Hisham heard this he said, `By Allah, I will deal with him for you.' So he went to Al-Walid's house and entered upon him. He said to Al-Walid, `Don't you see that your people are collecting charity for you' Al-Walid replied, `Don't I have more wealth and children than they do' Abu Jahl answered, `They are saying that you only went to Ibn Abi Quhafah's house so that you can get some of his food.' Al-Walid then said, `Is this what my tribe is saying Nay, by Allah, I am not seeking to be close to Ibn Abi Quhafah, nor `Umar, nor Ibn Abi Kabshah. And his speech is only inherited magic of old.' So Allah revealed to His Messenger ,\nذَرْنِى وَمَنْ خَلَقْتُ وَحِيداً \n(Leave me alone with whom I created lonely.) until His statement,\nلاَ تُبْقِى وَلاَ تَذَرُ \n(It spares not, nor does it leave (anything)!)\" Qatadah said, \"They claim that he (Al-Walid) said, `By Allah, I thought about what the man says, and it is not poetry.

He (Ibn `Abbas) said, \"Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah entered the house of Abu Bakr bin Abi Quhafah and asked him about the Qur'an. When Abu Bakr informed him about it, he left and went to the Quraysh saying, `What a great thing this is that Ibn Abi Kabshah is saying. I swear by Allah that it is not poetry, nor magic, nor the prattling of insanity. Verily, his speech is from the Words of Allah!' So when a group of the Quraysh heard this they gathered and said, `By Allah, if Al-Walid converts (to Islam) all of the Quraysh will convert.' When Abu Jahl bin Hisham heard this he said, `By Allah, I will deal with him for you.' So he went to Al-Walid's house and entered upon him. He said to Al-Walid, `Don't you see that your people are collecting charity for you' Al-Walid replied, `Don't I have more wealth and children than they do' Abu Jahl answered, `They are saying that you only went to Ibn Abi Quhafah's house so that you can get some of his food.' Al-Walid then said, `Is this what my tribe is saying Nay, by Allah, I am not seeking to be close to Ibn Abi Quhafah, nor `Umar, nor Ibn Abi Kabshah. And his speech is only inherited magic of old.' So Allah revealed to His Messenger ,\nذَرْنِى وَمَنْ خَلَقْتُ وَحِيداً \n(Leave me alone with whom I created lonely.) until His statement,\nلاَ تُبْقِى وَلاَ تَذَرُ \n(It spares not, nor does it leave (anything)!)\" Qatadah said, \"They claim that he (Al-Walid) said, `By Allah, I thought about what the man says, and it is not poetry.

So Allah revealed,\nفَقُتِلَ كَيْفَ قَدَّرَ \n(So let him be cursed, how he plotted!)\nثُمَّ عَبَسَ وَبَسَرَ \n(Then he frowned and he looked in a bad tempered way.)

He invents lies against Allah's Ayat and claims that they are the words of a man. Allah recounts to him His favors upon him when He says,\nذَرْنِى وَمَنْ خَلَقْتُ وَحِيداً \n(Leave Me alone (to deal) with whom I created lonely.) meaning, he came out of the womb of his mother alone, without any wealth or children. Then, Allah provided him with\nمَالاً مَّمْدُوداً\n(resources in abundance.) meaning, vast and abundant. Allah then made for him,\nوَبَنِينَ شُهُوداً \n(And children attending.) Mujahid said, \"They are not absent.\" This means that they are present with him. They do not travel for business and trade. Rather, their servants and hired workers handle all of that for them while they are sitting with their father. He enjoys their company and delights in being with them.\nوَمَهَّدتُّ لَهُ تَمْهِيداً \n(And made life smooth and comfortable for him.) meaning, `I made possible for him to amass wealth, luxuries and other than that.'\nثُمَّ يَطْمَعُ أَنْ أَزِيدَ - كَلاَّ إِنَّهُ كان لاٌّيَـتِنَا عَنِيداً \n(After all that he desires that I should give more. Nay! Verily, he has been opposing Our Ayat.) meaning, obstinate. This refers to his ungratefulness for his blessings after knowing (these blessings). Allah says,\nسَأُرْهِقُهُ صَعُوداً \n(I shall force him to Sa`ud!) Qatadah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, \"Sa`ud is a rock in Hell that the disbeliever will be dragged across on his face.\" As-Suddi said, \"Sa`ud is a slippery rock in Hell that he will be forced to climb.\" Mujahid said,\nسَأُرْهِقُهُ صَعُوداً \n(I shall force him to Sa`ud!) \"This is a harsh portion of the torment.\" Qatadah said, \"It is a torment that contains no relaxation (break for relief).\" Concerning Allah's statement,\nإِنَّهُ فَكَّرَ وَقَدَّرَ \n(Verily, he thought and plotted.) meaning, `We only caused him to face the grievous torment of Sa`ud, that is Our bringing him close to the harsh torment, because he was far away from faith.' This was because he thought and plotted, meaning he contemplated what he should say about the Qur'an when he was asked about it. So he deliberated over what statement he should invent against it.\nوَقَدَّرَ\n(and plotted.) meaning, he contemplated.\nفَقُتِلَ كَيْفَ قَدَّرَ - ثُمَّ قُتِلَ كَيْفَ قَدَّرَ \n(So let him be cursed, how he plotted! And once more let him be cursed, how he plotted!) This is a supplication against him.\nثُمَّ نَظَرَ \n(Then he thought.) meaning, he thought again and deliberated.\nثُمَّ عَبَسَ\n(Then he frowned) meaning, he contracted his eyebrows together and frowned.\nوَبَسَرَ\n(and he looked in a bad tempered way.) meaning, he scowled and was disgusted. Concerning Allah's statement,\nثُمَّ أَدْبَرَ وَاسْتَكْبَرَ \n(Then he turned back, and was proud.) meaning, he turned away from the truth and arrogantly refused to accept and submit to the Qur'an.\nفَقَالَ إِنْ هَـذَآ إِلاَّ سِحْرٌ يُؤْثَرُ \n(Then he said: \"This is nothing but magic from that of old.\") meaning, `this is magic that Muhammad received from those who were before him, and he is merely saying what he got from them.' This is why he said,\nإِنْ هَـذَآ إِلاَّ قَوْلُ الْبَشَرِ \n(This is nothing but the word of a human being!) meaning, it is not the Words of Allah. The person who is mentioned in this discussion is Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah Al-Makhzumi. He was one of the chiefs of the Quraysh -- may Allah curse him. Among the narrations about this is what was reported by Al-`Awfi from Ibn `Abbas. He (Ibn `Abbas) said, \"Al-Walid bin Al-Mughirah entered the house of Abu Bakr bin Abi Quhafah and asked him about the Qur'an. When Abu Bakr informed him about it, he left and went to the Quraysh saying, `What a great thing this is that Ibn Abi Kabshah is saying. I swear by Allah that it is not poetry, nor magic, nor the prattling of insanity. Verily, his speech is from the Words of Allah!' So when a group of the Quraysh heard this they gathered and said, `By Allah, if Al-Walid converts (to Islam) all of the Quraysh will convert.' When Abu Jahl bin Hisham heard this he said, `By Allah, I will deal with him for you.' So he went to Al-Walid's house and entered upon him. He said to Al-Walid, `Don't you see that your people are collecting charity for you' Al-Walid replied, `Don't I have more wealth and children than they do' Abu Jahl answered, `They are saying that you only went to Ibn Abi Quhafah's house so that you can get some of his food.' Al-Walid then said, `Is this what my tribe is saying Nay, by Allah, I am not seeking to be close to Ibn Abi Quhafah, nor `Umar, nor Ibn Abi Kabshah. And his speech is only inherited magic of old.' So Allah revealed to His Messenger ,\nذَرْنِى وَمَنْ خَلَقْتُ وَحِيداً \n(Leave me alone with whom I created lonely.) until His statement,\nلاَ تُبْقِى وَلاَ تَذَرُ \n(It spares not, nor does it leave (anything)!)\" Qatadah said, \"They claim that he (Al-Walid) said, `By Allah, I thought about what the man says, and it is not poetry. Verily, it has a sweetness and it is truly elegant. Verily, it is exalted and it is not overcome. And I have no doubt that it is magic.' So Allah revealed,\nفَقُتِلَ كَيْفَ قَدَّرَ \n(So let him be cursed, how he plotted!)\nثُمَّ عَبَسَ وَبَسَرَ \n(Then he frowned and he looked in a bad tempered way.) He contracted his eyes together and scowled.\" Allah says,\nسَأُصْلِيهِ سَقَرَ \n(I will cast him into Saqar.) meaning, `I will engulf him in it from all his sides.' Then Allah says,\nوَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا سَقَرُ \n(And what will make you know (exactly) what Saqar is) This is to give fright and emphasis to its matter. Then Allah explains this by His saying,\n   لَا تُبْقِي وَلَا تَذَرُ        \n(It spares not, nor does it leave (anything)!) meaning, it eats their flesh, veins, nerves and their skins. Then their organs will be changed into something else. They will remain in this (form), not living or dying. This was stated by Ibn Buraydah, Abu Sinan and others. Concerning Allah's statement,\nلَوَّاحَةٌ لِّلْبَشَرِ \n(Scorching for the humans!) Mujahid said, \"This means for the skin.\" Qatadah said,\nلَوَّاحَةٌ لِّلْبَشَرِ \n(Scorching for the humans!) \"This means burning the skin.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"Burning the skin of man.\" Concerning Allah's statement,\nعَلَيْهَا تِسْعَةَ عَشَرَ \n(Over it are nineteen.) meaning, the first of the guardians of Hell. They are magnificent in (their appearance) and harsh in their character.","verse_meta": {},"text_arabic_simple": "ذرني ومن خلقت وحيدا ١١ وجعلت له مالا ممدودا ١٢ وبنين شهودا ١٣ ومهدت له تمهيدا ١٤ ثم يطمع ان ازيد ١٥ كلا انه كان لاياتنا عنيدا ١٦ سارهقه صعودا ١٧ انه فكر وقدر ١٨ فقتل كيف قدر ١٩ ثم قتل كيف قدر ٢٠ذَرْنِى وَمَنْ خَلَقْتُ وَحِيدًۭا ١١ وَجَعَلْتُ لَهُۥ مَالًۭا مَّمْدُودًۭا ١٢ وَبَنِينَ شُهُودًۭا ١٣ وَمَهَّدتُّ لَهُۥ تَمْهِيدًۭا ١٤ ثُمَّ يَطْمَعُ أَنْ أَزِيدَ ١٥ كَلَّآ ۖ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ لِـَٔايَـٰتِنَا عَنِيدًۭا ١٦ سَأُرْهِقُهُۥ صَعُودًا ١٧ إِنَّهُۥ فَكَّرَ وَقَدَّرَ ١٨ فَقُتِلَ كَيْفَ قَدَّرَ ١٩ ثُمَّ قُتِلَ كَيْفَ قَدَّرَ","text_arabic_uthmani": "ذرني ومن خلقت وحيدا ١١ وجعلت له مالا ممدودا ١٢ وبنين شهودا ١٣ ومهدت له تمهيدا ١٤ ثم يطمع ان ازيد ١٥ كلا انه كان لاياتنا عنيدا ١٦ سارهقه صعودا ١٧ انه فكر وقدر ١٨ فقتل كيف قدر ١٩ ثم قتل كيف قدر","fetched_at": 1761805991.286518}

Guardian angels, stern and severe. This is a refutation of the idolators of the Quraysh when they mentioned the number of guardian angels. Abu Jahl said, \"O people of Quraysh!

Concerning Allah's statement,\nوَيَزْدَادَ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ إِيمَـناً\n(and that the believers may increase in faith.) meaning, to their faith. This is due to what they witness from the truthfulness of the information of their Prophet, Muhammad ﷺ.\nوَلاَ يَرْتَابَ الَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ الْكِتَـبَ وَالْمُؤْمِنُونَ وَلِيَقُولَ الَّذِينَ فِى قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ\n(and that no doubt may be left for the People of the Scripture and the believers, and that those in whose hearts is a disease) meaning, among the hypocrites.\nوَالْكَـفِرُونَ مَاذَآ أَرَادَ اللَّهُ بِهَـذَا مَثَلاً\n(and the disbelievers may say: \"What does Allah intend by this example\") meaning, they say, \"What is the wisdom in mentioning this here\" Allah says,\nكَذَلِكَ يُضِلُّ اللَّهُ مَن يَشَآءُ وَيَهْدِى مَن يَشَآءُ\n(Thus Allah leads astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills.) meaning, by way of examples like this, faith becomes firm in the hearts of some people and it is shaken with others.

This was said by Abu Hurayrah. Hammad bin Salamah reported from `Ali bin Zayd who reported from Yusuf bin Mihran who narrated that Ibn `Abbas said, \"It (Qaswarah) is the lion in the Arabic language.

Mujahid and others have said this. This is similar to Allah's statement,\nوَإِذَا جَآءَتْهُمْ ءَايَةٌ قَالُواْ لَن نُّؤْمِنَ حَتَّى نُؤْتَى مِثْلَ مَآ أُوتِىَ رُسُلُ اللَّهِ اللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ حَيْثُ يَجْعَلُ رِسَالَتَهُ\n(And when there comes to them a sign they say: \"We shall not believe until we receive the like of that which the Messengers of Allah ﷺ had received.\" Allah knows best with whom to place His Message.)

But they fear not the Hereafter.) meaning, they were only corrupted by their lack of faith in it and their rejection of its occurrence.\nThe Qur'an is a Reminder\nThen Allah says,\nكَلاَّ إِنَّهُ تَذْكِرَةٌ\n(Nay, verily, this is an admonition.) meaning, truly the Qur'an is a reminder.\nفَمَن شَآءَ ذَكَرَهُ وَمَا يَذْكُرُونَ إِلاَّ أَن يَشَآءَ اللَّهُ\n(So, whosoever wills receives admonition (from it)!

Ibn `Abbas and others have said this.\nإِلاَّ أَصْحَـبَ الْيَمِينِ\n(Except those on the Right.) For verily, they will be\nفِى جَنَّـتٍ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ - عَنِ الْمُجْرِمِينَ\n(In Gardens they will ask one another, about criminals (and they will say to them)) meaning, while they are in lofty rooms they will ask the criminals, who will be in the lowest levels (of Hell), saying to them,\nمَا سَلَكَكُمْ فِى سَقَرَ - قَالُواْ لَمْ نَكُ مِنَ الْمُصَلِّينَ - وَلَمْ نَكُ نُطْعِمُ الْمِسْكِينَ\n(\"What has caused you to enter Hell\" They will say: \"We were not of those who used to offer the Salah, nor did we feed the poor.\") meaning, `we did not worship Allah, nor did we do good to His creatures of our own species (i.e., other people).'\nوَكُنَّا نَخُوضُ مَعَ الُخَآئِضِينَ\n(And we used to speak falsehood with vain speakers.) meaning, `we used to speak about what we had no knowledge of.' Qatadah said, \"It means that every time someone went astray we would go astray with them.\"\nوَكُنَّا نُكَذِّبُ بِيَوْمِ الدِّينِ - حَتَّى أَتَـنَا الْيَقِينُ\n(And we used to deny the Day of Recompense, until the certainty (Al-Yaqin) came to us.) meaning, death. This is as Allah says,\nوَاعْبُدْ رَبَّكَ حَتَّى يَأْتِيَكَ الْيَقِينُ\n(And worship your Lord until there comes unto you the certainty.) (15:99) The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«أَمَّا هُوَ يعني عثمان بن مظعون فَقَدْ جَاءَهُ الْيَقِينُ مِنْ رَبِّه»\n(Concerning him verily, Al-Yaqin (death) came to him from his Lord.)\" Allah then says,\nفَمَا تَنفَعُهُمْ شَفَـعَةُ الشَّـفِعِينَ\n(So no intercession of intercessors will be of any use to them.) meaning, whoever has these characteristics, then the intercession of whoever tries to intercede for him will be of no benefit on the Day of Judgement. This is because intercession is only useful if the conditions for it are met. However, whoever comes before Allah as a disbeliever on the Day of Judgement, then he will get the Hellfire and there is no way of avoiding it. He will abide in it (Hell) forever.\nThe Disapproval of the Disbelievers' Rejection and Their Position\nThen Allah says,\nفَمَا لَهُمْ عَنِ التَّذْكِرَةِ مُعْرِضِينَ\n(Then what is wrong with them that they turn away from admonition) meaning, `what is wrong with these disbelievers who are turning away from what you are calling them to and reminding them of'\nكَأَنَّهُمْ حُمُرٌ مُّسْتَنفِرَةٌ - فَرَّتْ مِن قَسْوَرَةٍ\n(As if they were wild donkeys. Fleeing from a Qaswarah.) meaning, as if they were fleeing from the truth and turning away from it, like a wild donkey when it flees from something that is trying to catch it, like a lion. This was said by Abu Hurayrah. Hammad bin Salamah reported from `Ali bin Zayd who reported from Yusuf bin Mihran who narrated that Ibn `Abbas said, \"It (Qaswarah) is the lion in the Arabic language. It is called Qaswarah in the Abyssinian language, Sher in the Persian language and Awba in the Nabtiyyah (Nabatean) language.\" Concerning Allah's statement,\nبَلْ يُرِيدُ كُلُّ امْرِىءٍ مِّنْهُمْ أَن يُؤْتَى صُحُفاً مُّنَشَّرَةً\n(Nay, everyone of them desires that he should be given pages spread out.) meaning, each one of these idolators wants to have a book revealed to him as Allah revealed to the Prophet . Mujahid and others have said this. This is similar to Allah's statement,\nوَإِذَا جَآءَتْهُمْ ءَايَةٌ قَالُواْ لَن نُّؤْمِنَ حَتَّى نُؤْتَى مِثْلَ مَآ أُوتِىَ رُسُلُ اللَّهِ اللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ حَيْثُ يَجْعَلُ رِسَالَتَهُ\n(And when there comes to them a sign they say: \"We shall not believe until we receive the like of that which the Messengers of Allah ﷺ had received.\" Allah knows best with whom to place His Message.)
