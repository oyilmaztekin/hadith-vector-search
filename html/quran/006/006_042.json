    "text": "<h2>The Idolators Call On Allah Alone During Torment and Distress</h2><p>Allah states that He does what He wills with His creatures and none can resist His decision or avert what He decrees for them. He is the One Who has no partners, Who accepts the supplication from whomever He wills. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُكُم إِنْ أَتَـكُمْ عَذَابُ اللَّهِ أَوْ أَتَتْكُمْ السَّاعَةُ أَغَيْرَ اللَّهِ تَدْعُونَ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ </div><p>(Say: \"Tell me if Allah's torment comes upon you, or the Hour comes upon you, would you then call upon any one other than Allah (Reply) if you are truthful!\") This means, you -- disbelievers -- will not call other than Allah in this case, because you know that none except He is able to remove the affliction. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ</div><p>(if you are truthful) by taking gods besides Him. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلْ إِيَّـهُ تَدْعُونَ فَيَكْشِفُ مَا تَدْعُونَ إِلَيْهِ إِنْ شَآءَ وَتَنسَوْنَ مَا تُشْرِكُونَ </div><p>(Nay! To Him alone you call, and, if He willed, He would remove that (distress) for which you call upon Him, and you forget at that time whatever partners you joined with Him (in worship)!) for in times of necessity, you only call on Allah and forget your idols and false deities. In another Ayah, Allah said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا مَسَّكُمُ الْضُّرُّ فِى الْبَحْرِ ضَلَّ مَن تَدْعُونَ إِلاَ إِيَّاهُ</div><p>(And when harm touches you upon the sea, those that you call upon besides Him vanish from you except Him (Allah)) 17:67. Allah said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ أَرْسَلنَآ إِلَى أُمَمٍ مِّن قَبْلِكَ فَأَخَذْنَـهُمْ بِالْبَأْسَآءِ</div><p>(Verily, We sent (Messengers) to many nations before you. And We seized them with extreme poverty...) That is, loss of wealth and diminished provisions, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالضَّرَّآءِ</div><p>(and loss of health) various illnesses, diseases and pain, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَضَرَّعُونَ</div><p>(so that they might believe with humility) and call Allah and supplicate to Him with humbleness and humility. Allah said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَوْلا إِذْ جَآءَهُمْ بَأْسُنَا تَضَرَّعُواْ</div><p>(When Our torment reached them, why then did they not believe with humility) Meaning: Why do they not believe and humble themselves before Us when We test them with disaster' </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَـكِن قَسَتْ قُلُوبُهُمْ</div><p>(But their hearts became hardened,) for their hearts are not soft or humble, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَزَيَّنَ لَهُمُ الشَّيْطَـنُ مَا كَانُواّ يَعْمَلُونَ</div><p>(and Shaytan made fair-seeming to them that which they used to do. ) That is, Shirk, defiance and rebellion. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّا نَسُواْ مَا ذُكِّرُواْ بِهِ</div><p>(So, when they forgot (the warning) with which they had been reminded,) by ignoring and turning away from it, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ أَبْوَابَ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ</div><p>(We opened to them the gates of everything,) Meaning: `We opened the gates of provisions for them from wherever they wished, so that We deceive them.' We seek refuge with Allah from such an end. This is why Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَتَّى إِذَا فَرِحُواْ بِمَآ أُوتُواْ</div><p>f(until in the midst of their enjoyment in that which they were given,) such as wealth, children and provisions, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَخَذْنَـهُمْ بَغْتَةً فَإِذَا هُمْ مُّبْلِسُونَ</div><p>(all of a sudden, We took them to punishment and lo! They were plunged into destruction with deep regrets and sorrows.) They have no hope for any type of good thing. Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, \"Whomever Allah gives provision and he thinks that Allah is not testing him, has no wisdom. Whomever has little provision and thinks that Allah will not look at (provide for) him, has no wisdom.\" He then recited the Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّا نَسُواْ مَا ذُكِّرُواْ بِهِ فَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ أَبْوَابَ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ حَتَّى إِذَا فَرِحُواْ بِمَآ أُوتُواْ أَخَذْنَـهُمْ بَغْتَةً فَإِذَا هُمْ مُّبْلِسُونَ </div><p>(So, when they forgot (the warning) with which they had been reminded, We opened to them the gates of every (pleasant) thing, until in the midst of their enjoyment in that which they were given, all of a sudden, We took them to punishment, and lo! They were plunged into destruction with deep regrets and sorrows.) He added, \"By the Lord of the Ka`bah! Allah deceived these people, when He gave them what they wished, and then they were punished.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded this statement. </p>"
