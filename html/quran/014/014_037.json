Ibn Jarir At-Tabari commented that this, \"Refers to his earlier statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الْمُحَرَّمِ</div><p>(the Sacred...),\" meaning, `You have made this House Sacred so that people establish the prayer next to it,'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاجْعَلْ أَفْئِدَةً مَّنَ النَّاسِ تَهْوِى إِلَيْهِمْ</div><p>(So fill some hearts among men with love towards them,) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Sa'id bin Jubayr said, \"Had Ibrahim said, `The hearts of mankind', Persians, Romans, the Jews, the Christians and all other people would have gathered around it.\" However, Ibrahim said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِنَ النَّاسِ</div><p>(among men), thus making it exclusive to Muslims only. He said next,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَارْزُقْهُمْ مِّنَ الثَّمَرَتِ</div><p>(and (O Allah) provide them with fruits) in order that they may be helped in obeying You, and because this is a barren valley; bring to them fruits that they might eat. Allah accepted Ibrahim's supplication,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَلَمْ نُمَكِّن لَّهُمْ حَرَماً ءَامِناً يُجْبَى إِلَيْهِ ثَمَرَاتُ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ رِّزْقاً مِّن لَّدُنَّا</div><p>(Have We not established for them a secure sanctuary (Makkah), to which are brought fruits of all kinds, a provision from Ourselves.) 28:57 This only indicates Allah's compassion, kindness, mercy and blessing, in that there are no fruit producing trees in the Sacred City, Makkah, yet all kinds of fruits are being brought to it from all around; this is how Allah accepted the supplication of the Khalil - Allah's intimate friend, Prophet Ibrahim, peace be upon him.</p>"
