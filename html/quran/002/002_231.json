    "text": "<h2>Being Kind to the Divorced Wife</h2><p>This is a command from Allah to men that when one of them divorces his wife with a reversible divorce, he should treat her kindly. So when her term of `Iddah (waiting period) nears its end, he either takes her back in a way that is better, including having witnesses that he has taken her back, and he lives with her with kindness. Or, he should release her after her `Iddah finishes and then kindly asks her to depart from his house, without disputing, fighting with her or using foul words. Allah then said:</p><p>وَلاَ تُمْسِكُوهُنَّ ضِرَارًا لِّتَعْتَدُواْ</p><p>(But do not take them back to hurt them,)</p><p>Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Masruq, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Ar-Rabi` and Muqatil bin Hayyan said that a man used to divorce his wife, and when her `Iddah came near its end, he would take her back to harm her and to stop her from marrying someone else. He then divorced her and she would begin her `Iddah and when her `Iddah term neared its end, he would take her back again, so that the term of `Iddah would be prolonged for her. After that, Allah prohibited this practice. Allah has also threatened those who indulge in such practices, when He said;</p><p>وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذَلِكَ فَقَدْ ظَلَمَ نَفْسَهُ</p><p>(...and whoever does that, then he has wronged himself.) meaning, by defying Allah's commandments. Allah then said:</p><p>وَلاَ تَتَّخِذُواْ آيَـتِ اللَّهِ هُزُوًا</p><p>(And treat not the verses (Laws) of Allah in a jest,)</p><p>Ibn Jarir said that Abu Musa (Al-Ash`ari) narrated that Allah's Messenger ﷺ once became angry at the Ash`ari tribe. Abu Musa went to him and said, \"O Messenger of Allah ﷺ! Are you angry with the Ash`ariyyin\" The Prophet said:</p><p>«يَقُولُ أَحَدُكُمْ: قَدْ طَلَّقْتُ، قَدْ رَاجَعْتُ، لَيْسَ هَذَا طَلَاقُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ، طَلِّقُوا الْمَرْأَةَ فِي قُبُلِ عِدَّتِهَا»</p><p>(One of you says, `I divorced her' -then says- `I took her back!' This is not the appropriate way Muslims conduct divorce. Divorce the woman when she has fulfilled the term of the prescribed period.)</p><p>Masruq said that the Ayah refers to the man who harms his wife by divorcing her and then taking her back, so that the `Iddah term is prolonged for her. Al-Hasan, Qatadah, `Ata' Al-Khurasani, Ar-Rabi` and Muqatil bin Hayyan said, \"He is the man who divorces his wife and says, `I was joking.' Or he frees a servant or gets married and says, `I was only joking.' Allah revealed:</p><p>وَلاَ تَتَّخِذُواْ آيَـتِ اللَّهِ هُزُوًا</p><p>(And treat not the verses (Laws) of Allah in a jest,)</p><p>Then such men were made to bear the consequences of their actions.</p><p>Allah then said:</p><p>وَاذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَتَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ</p><p>(. ..but remember Allah's favors on you,) meaning, by His sending His Messenger with the right guidance and clear signs to you:</p><p>وَمَآ أَنزَلَ عَلَيْكُم مِّنَ الْكِتَـبِ وَالْحِكْمَةِ</p><p>(...and that which He has sent down to you of the Book (i.e., the Qur'an) and Al-Hikmah) meaning the Sunnah,</p><p>يَعِظُكُمْ بِهِ</p><p>(...whereby He instructs you.) meaning, commands you, forbids you and threatens you for transgressing His prohibitions. Allah said:</p><p>وَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ</p><p>(And fear Allah) meaning, concerning what you perform and what you avoid,</p><p>وَاعْلَمُواْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمٌ</p><p>(and know that Allah is All-Aware of everything.) none of your secret or public affairs ever escapes His knowledge, and He will treat you accordingly.</p>"
