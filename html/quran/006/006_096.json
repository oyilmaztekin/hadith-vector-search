    "text": "<h2>Recognizing Allah Through Some of His Ayat</h2><p>Allah states that He causes the seed grain and the fruit stone to split and sprout in the ground, producing various types, colors, shapes, and tastes of grains and produce. The Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَالِقُ الْحَبِّ وَالنَّوَى</div><p>(Who causes the seed grain and the fruit stone to split and sprout.) is explained by the next statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يُخْرِجُ الْحَىَّ مِنَ الْمَيِّتِ وَمُخْرِجُ الْمَيِّتِ مِنَ الْحَىِّ</div><p>(He brings forth the living from the dead, and it is He Who brings forth the deed from the living.) meaning, He brings the living plant from the seed grain and the fruit stone, which is a lifless and inanimate object. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَءَايَةٌ لَّهُمُ الاٌّرْضُ الْمَيْتَةُ أَحْيَيْنَـهَا وَأَخْرَجْنَا مِنْهَا حَبّاً فَمِنْهُ يَأْكُلُونَ </div><p>(And a sign for them is the dead land. We gave it life, and We brought forth from it grains, so that they eat thereof.) 36:33 until, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِنْ أَنفُسِهِمْ وَمِمَّا لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(as well as of their own (human) kind (male and female), and of that which they know not.) 36:36 Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيُخْرِجُ الْمَيِّتَ مِنَ الْحَىِّ</div><p>(and it is He Who brings forth the dead from the living. ) There are similar expressions in meaning such as, He brings the egg from the chicken, and the opposite. Others said that it means, He brings the wicked offspring from the righteous parent and the opposite, and there are other possible meanings for the Ayah. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذَلِكُـمُ اللَّهُ</div><p>(Such is Allah,) meaning, He Who does all this, is Allah, the One and Only without partners, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَنَّى تُؤْفَكُونَ</div><p>(then how are you deluded away from the truth) meaning, look how you are deluded from Truth to the falsehood of worshipping others besides Allah. Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَالِقُ الإِصْبَاحِ وَجَعَلَ الَّيْلَ سَكَناً</div><p>((He is the) Cleaver of the daybreak. He has appointed the night for resting,) means, He is the Creator of light and darkness. Allah said in the beginning of the Surah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلَ الظُّلُمَـتِ وَالنُّورَ</div><p>(And originated the darkness and the light.) Indeed, Allah causes the darkness of the night to disappear and brings forth the day, thus bringing brighteness to the world and light to the horizon, while dissipating darkness and ending the night with its depth of darkness and starting the day with its brightness and light. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يُغْشِى الَّيْلَ النَّهَارَ يَطْلُبُهُ حَثِيثًا</div><p>(He brings the night as a cover over the day, seeking it rapidly.) 7:54 In this Ayah, Allah reminds of His ability to create diversified things in opposites, testifying to His perfect greatness and supreme power. Allah states that He is the Cleaver of the daybreak and mentioned its opposite, when He said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلَ الَّيْلَ سَكَناً</div><p>(He has appointed the night for resting,) meaning, created darkness, in order for the creation to become halt and rest during it. Allah said in other Ayat, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالضُّحَى - وَالَّيْلِ إِذَا سَجَى </div><p>(By the forenoon. And by the night when it is still.) 93:1-2, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّيْلِ إِذَا يَغْشَى - وَالنَّهَارِ إِذَا تَجَلَّى </div><p>(By the night as it envelops. And by the day as it appears in brightness.) 92:1,2 and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالنَّهَارِ إِذَا جَلَّـهَا - وَالَّيْلِ إِذَا يَغْشَـهَا </div><p>(And by the day as it shows up (the sun's) brightness. And by the night as it conceals it.) 91:3-4 Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ حُسْبَاناً</div><p>(...And the sun and the moon for reckoning.) means, the sun and the moon have specific orbits, according to a term appointed with magnificent precision that never changes or alters. Both the sun and the moon have distinct positions that they assume in summer and winter, effecting changes in the length of night and day. Allah said in other Ayat, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هُوَ الَّذِى جَعَلَ الشَّمْسَ ضِيَآءً وَالْقَمَرَ نُوراً وَقَدَّرَهُ مَنَازِلَ</div><p>(It is He Who made the sun a shining thing and the Moon as a light and measured out stages for it.) 10:5, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ الشَّمْسُ يَنبَغِى لَهَآ أَن تدْرِكَ القَمَرَ وَلاَ الَّيْلُ سَابِقُ النَّهَارِ وَكُلٌّ فِى فَلَكٍ يَسْبَحُونَ </div><p>(It is not for the sun to overtake the moon, nor does the night outstrip the day. They all float, each in an orbit.) 36:40, And, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ وَالنُّجُومَ مُسَخَّرَتٍ بِأَمْرِهِ</div><p>(The sun and the moon; and the stars are subjected by His command.) 16:12 Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذَلِكَ تَقْدِيرُ الْعَزِيزِ الْعَلِيمِ</div><p>(Such is the measuring of the Almighty, the All-Knowing.) means, all of this occurs according to the decree and due measurement of the Almighty Who is never resisted or contradicted. He is the Knower of all things and nothing ever escapes His knowledge, not even the weight of an atom on earth or in heavens. Allah often mentions the creation of the night, the day, the sun and the moon and then ends His Speech by mentioning His attributes of power and knowledge, as in this Ayah above 6:96, and in His statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَءَايَةٌ لَّهُمُ الَّيْلُ نَسْلَخُ مِنْهُ النَّهَارَ فَإِذَا هُم مُّظْلِمُونَ - وَالشَّمْسُ تَجْرِى لِمُسْتَقَرٍّ لَّهَـا ذَلِكَ تَقْدِيرُ الْعَزِيزِ الْعَلِيمِ </div><p>(And a sign for them is the night, We withdraw therefrom the day, and behold, they are in darkness. And the sun runs on its fixed course for a term. That is the decree of the Almighty, the All-Knowing.) 36:37-38 In the beginning of Surat Ha-Mim As-Sajdah, after mentioning the creation of the heavens and earth and all that is in them, Allah said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَزَيَّنَّا السَّمَآءَ الدُّنْيَا بِمَصَـبِيحَ وَحِفْظاً ذَلِكَ تَقْدِيرُ الْعَزِيزِ الْعَلِيمِ</div><p>(And We adorned the nearest (lowest) heaven with lamps (stars) to be an adornment as well as to guard. Such is the decree of Him, the Almighty, the All-Knower.) 41:12 Allah said next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ النُّجُومَ لِتَهْتَدُواْ بِهَا فِى ظُلُمَـتِ الْبَرِّ وَالْبَحْرِ</div><p>(It is He Who has set the stars for you, so that you may guide your course with their help through the darkness of the land and the sea.) Some of the Salaf said; Whoever believes in other than three things about these stars, then he has made a mistake, and lied against Allah. Indeed Allah made them as decorations for the heavens, and to shoot at the Shayatin, and for directions in the dark recesses of the land and sea. Then, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَدْ فَصَّلْنَا الآيَـتِ</div><p>(We have explained in detail Our Ayat.) meaning, We made them clear and plain, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِقَوْمٍ يَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(for people who know. ) who have sound minds and are able to recognize the truth and avoid falsehood. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الَّذِى أَنشَأَكُم مِّن نَّفْسٍ وَحِدَةٍ فَمُسْتَقَرٌّ وَمُسْتَوْدَعٌ قَدْ فَصَّلْنَا الاٌّيَـتِ لِقَوْمٍ يَفْقَهُونَ </div>"
