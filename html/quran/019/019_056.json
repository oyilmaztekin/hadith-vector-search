It has previously been mentioned that in the Sahih it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ  passed by Idris on the night of the Isra (Night Journey) and he (Idris) was in the fourth heaven. Sufyan reported from Mansur that Mujahid said,</p><p>وَرَفَعْنَاهُ مَكَاناً عَلِيّاً</p><p>(And We raised him to a high station.) \"This means the fourth heaven.\" Al-Hasan and others said concer- ning Allah's statement,</p><p>وَرَفَعْنَاهُ مَكَاناً عَلِيّاً</p><p>(And We raised him to a high station.) \"This means Paradise.\"</p>"
