    "text": "<h2>The People's admission of their gods' incapability, and Ibrahim's preaching</h2><p>Allah tells us that when Ibrahim said what he said, his people</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَرَجَعُواْ إِلَى أَنفُسِهِمْ</div><p>(turned to themselves) meaning, they blamed themselves for not taking precautions and protecting their gods. They said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ أَنتُمُ الظَّـلِمُونَ</div><p>(Verily, you are the wrongdoers) i.e., because you neglected them and did not guard them.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ نُكِسُواْ عَلَى رُءُوسِهِمْ</div><p>(Then they turned to themselves) means, they looked at the ground, and said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ عَلِمْتَ مَا هَـؤُلاءِ يَنطِقُونَ</div><p>(Indeed you (Ibrahim) know well that these speak not!) Qatadah said: \"The people admitted their guilt and confusion, and said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ عَلِمْتَ مَا هَـؤُلاءِ يَنطِقُونَ</div><p>(\"Indeed you know well that these speak not!\") `So how can you tell us to ask them, if they cannot speak and you know that they cannot speak' At this point, when they admitted that, Ibrahim said to them:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَتَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ مَا لاَ يَنفَعُكُمْ شَيْئاً وَلاَ يَضُرُّكُمْ</div><p>(Do you then worship besides Allah, things that can neither profit you nor harm you) meaning, if they can- not speak and they can neither benefit you nor harm you, then why do you worship them instead of Allah</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُفٍّ لَّكُمْ وَلِمَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ </div><p>(Fie upon you, and upon that which you worship besides Allah! Have you then no sense) `Do you not realize the extent of the mis- guidance and extreme disbelief which you are following, which no one could accept but one who is an igno- rant and evil wrong- doer' He defeated them in argument and left them with no way out. Allah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتِلْكَ حُجَّتُنَآ ءَاتَيْنَـهَآ إِبْرَهِيمَ عَلَى قَوْمِهِ</div><p>e(And that was Our proof which We gave Ibrahim against his people) 6:83</p>"
