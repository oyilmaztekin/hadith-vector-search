    "text": "<h2>How Musa asked for the Support of His Brother and was granted that by Allah</h2><p>When Allah commanded him to go to Fir`awn, the one who he had run away from and whose vengeance he feared,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّى قَتَلْتُ مِنْهُمْ نَفْساً</div><p>( Musa said: My Lord! I have killed a man among them,) meaning, that Coptic,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَخَافُ أَن يَقْتُلُونِ</div><p>(and I fear that they will kill me.) i.e., `when they see me.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَخِى هَـرُونُ هُوَ أَفْصَحُ مِنِّى لِسَاناً</div><p>(And my brother Harun -- he is more eloquent in speech than me,) Musa, peace be upon him, had a speech defect, because when he had been given the choice between a date and a pearl, he mistakenly picked up a coal and placed it on his tongue, so he found it difficult to speak clearly. Musa said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاحْلُلْ عُقْدَةً مِّن لِّسَانِى - يَفْقَهُواْ قَوْلِي - وَاجْعَل لِّى وَزِيراً مِّنْ أَهْلِى - هَـرُونَ أَخِى - اشْدُدْ بِهِ أَزْرِى - وَأَشْرِكْهُ فِى أَمْرِى </div><p>(\"And loose the knot (the defect) from my tongue. That they understand my speech. And appoint for me a helper from my family, Harun, my brother. Increase my strength with him, And let him share my task.\") (20:27-32) meaning, `give me someone to keep me company in this immense task of prophethood and conveying the Message to this arrogant, tyrannical and stubborn king. ' Hence Musa said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَخِى هَـرُونُ هُوَ أَفْصَحُ مِنِّى لِسَاناً فَأَرْسِلْهِ مَعِىَ رِدْءاً</div><p>(And my brother Harun -- he is more eloquent in speech than me: so send him with me as a helper) meaning, as a support to give strength to my cause and confirm what I say and convey from Allah, because the word of two carries more weight in people's minds than the word of one. So he said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنِّى أَخَافُ أَن يُكَذِّبُونِ</div><p>(Verily, I fear that they will deny me.) Muhammad bin Ishaq said: c</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رِدْءاً يُصَدِّقُنِى</div><p>(as a helper to confirm me.) means, `to explain to them what I say, for he can understand me where they may not.' When Musa asked for this, Allah said to him:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَنَشُدُّ عَضُدَكَ بِأَخِيكَ</div><p>(We will strengthen your arm through your brother,) meaning, `We will add strength to your cause and give you help through your brother, who you have asked to be made a Prophet alongside you.' This is like the Ayat;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يمُوسَى</div><p>(You are granted your request, O Musa!) (20:36)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُ مِن رَّحْمَتِنَآ أَخَاهُ هَـرُونَ نَبِيّاً </div><p>(And We granted him his brother Harun, (also) a Prophet, out of Our mercy) (19:53). One of the Salaf said, \"There is no one who has ever done a greater favor to his brother than Musa did for Harun, may peace be upon them both, for he interceded for him until Allah made him a Prophet and Messenger with him to Fir`awn and his chiefs. Allah said concerning Musa:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَانَ عِندَ اللَّهِ وَجِيهاً</div><p>(he was honorable before Allah) (33:69).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنَجْعَلُ لَكُمَا سُلْطَـناً</div><p>(and (We will) give you both power) means, overwhelming evidence.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ يَصِلُونَ إِلَيْكُمَا بِـْايَـتِنَآ</div><p>(so they shall not be able to harm you, with Our Ayat;) means, `they will have no way or means of harming you because you are conveying the signs of Allah.' This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَـأَيُّهَا الرَّسُولُ بَلِّغْ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ</div><p>(O Messenger! Proclaim (the Message) which has been sent down to you from your Lord.) until His saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاللَّهُ يَعْصِمُكَ مِنَ النَّاسِ</div><p>(Allah will protect you from mankind) (5:67).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِينَ يُبَلِّغُونَ رِسَالـتِ اللَّهِ</div><p>(Those who convey the Message of Allah) until His saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَفَى بِاللَّهِ حَسِيباً</div><p>(And sufficient is Allah as a Reckoner) (33:39). And sufficient is Allah as a Helper and Supporter. And Allah told them the consequences in this world and the next, for them and for those who followed them,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَنتُمَا وَمَنِ اتَّبَعَكُمَا الْغَـلِبُونَ</div><p>(you two as well as those who follow you will be the victors.) This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَتَبَ اللَّهُ لاّغْلِبَنَّ أَنَاْ وَرُسُلِى إِنَّ اللَّهَ قَوِىٌّ عَزِيزٌ </div><p>(Allah has decreed: \"Verily, it is I and My Messengers who shall be the victorious.\" Verily, Allah is All-Powerful, All-Mighty.) (58:21)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّا لَنَنصُرُ رُسُلَنَا وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</div><p>(Verily, We will indeed make victorious Our Messengers and those who believe in this world's life) (40:51) to the end of the Ayah.</p>"
