He makes it easy for them to use ships to serve their interests, seeking His bounty through trade between one region and another. He says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ كَانَ بِكُمْ رَحِيمًا</div><p>(Truly, He is ever Most Merciful towards you.) meaning, He does this for you out of His grace and mercy towards you.</p>"
