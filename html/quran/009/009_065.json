    "text": "<h2>The Hypocrites rely on False, Misguided Excuses</h2><p>`Abdullah bin `Umar said, \"During the battle of Tabuk, a man was sitting in a gathering and said, `I have never seen like these reciters of ours! They have the hungriest stomachs, the most lying tongues and are the most cowardice in battle.' A man in the Masjid said, `You lie. You are a hypocrite, and I will surely inform the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. ' This statement was conveyed to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and also a part of the Qur'an was revealed about it.\"' `Abdullah bin `Umar said, \"I have seen that man afterwards holding onto the shoulders of the Messenger's camel while stones were falling on him, declaring, `O Allah's Messenger! We were only engaged in idle talk and jesting,' while the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was reciting,</p><p>أَبِاللَّهِ وَءَايَـتِهِ وَرَسُولِهِ كُنتُمْ تَسْتَهْزِءُونَ</p><p>(\"Was it at Allah, and His Ayat and His Messenger that you were mocking\") 9:65.\"' Allah said,</p><p>لاَ تَعْتَذِرُواْ قَدْ كَفَرْتُمْ بَعْدَ إِيمَـنِكُمْ</p><p>(Make no excuse; you disbelieved after you had believed.) on account of your statement and mocking,</p><p>إِن نَّعْفُ عَن طَآئِفَةٍ مِّنْكُمْ نُعَذِّبْ طَآئِفَةً</p><p>(If We pardon some of you, We will punish others among you) for not all of you will be forgiven, some will have to taste the torment,</p><p>بِأَنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ مُجْرِمِينَ</p><p>(because they were criminals), they were criminals because of this terrible, sinful statement.</p>"
