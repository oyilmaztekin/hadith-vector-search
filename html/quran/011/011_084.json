    "text": "<h2>The Story of the People of Madyan and the Call of Shu`ayb</h2><p>Allah, the Exalted, says, `We sent a Messenger to the people of Madyan.' They were a tribe of Arabs who lived between the land of the Al-Hijaz and Ash-Sham, close to the land of Ma`an. Their land was known by the name of their tribe and was thus, called Madyan. Allah sent unto them the Prophet Shu`ayb and he was of the noblest of them in lineage. For this reason, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَخَاهُمْ شُعَيْبًا</div><p>(their brother Shu`ayb.) Shu`ayb commanded them to worship Allah alone without associating any partners with him. He also prohibited them from cheating in their weights and measures (for business transactions). </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنِّى أَرَاكُمْ بِخَيْرٍ</div><p>(I see you in prosperity) meaning, `in your livelihood and your provisions. And verily, I fear that you will be deprived of this bounty that you are enjoying by violating Allah's prohibitions.' </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنِّى أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ مُّحِيطٍ</div><p>(and verily, I fear for you the torment of a Day encompassing.) This means the abode of the Hereafter. </p>"
