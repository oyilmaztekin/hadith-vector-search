The faces of those who followed splits and divisions will be blackened, and the faces of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah will be whitened. Allah says here: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ تَرَى الَّذِينَ كَذَبُواْ عَلَى اللَّهِ</div><p>(And on the Day of Resurrection you will see those who lied against Allah) meaning, by their claims that He had partners or offspring. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وُجُوهُهُم مُّسْوَدَّةٌ</div><p>(their faces will be black.) means, because of their lies and fabrications. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَيْسَ فِى جَهَنَّمَ مَثْوًى لِّلْمُتَكَبِّرِينَ</div><p>(Is there not in Hell an abode for the arrogant) means, is not Hell sufficient for them as a prison and humiliating final destination, because of their stubborn pride, arrogance and refusal to follow the truth </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيُنَجِّى اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ اتَّقَوْاْ بِمَفَازَتِهِمْ</div><p>(And Allah will deliver those who are those who have Taqwa to their places of success.) means, because of what Allah has decreed for them of happiness and victory. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ يَمَسُّهُمُ السُّوءُ</div><p>(Evil shall touch them not, ) means, on the Day of Resurrection. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ</div><p>(nor shall they grieve.) means, the greater terror (of that Day) will not cause them grief, for they will be safe from all grief and removed from all evil, and they will attain all that is good. </p>"
