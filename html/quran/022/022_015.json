They are those who believe firmly in their hearts and confirm their faith by their actions, doing all kinds of righteous deeds and avoiding evil actions. Because of this, they will inherit dwellings in the lofty ranks of the gardens of Paradise. So Allah tells us that He sends those astray and guides these, and says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَفْعَلُ مَا يُرِيدُ</div><p>(Verily, Allah does what He wills.)</p>"
