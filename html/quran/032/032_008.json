    "text": "<h2>The Creation of Man in Stages</h2><p>Allah tells us that He has created everything well and formed everything in a goodly fashion. Malik said, narrating from Zayd bin Aslam:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِى أَحْسَنَ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقَهُ</div><p>(Who made everything He has created good) means, \"He created everything well and in a goodly fashion.\" When Allah mentions the creation of the heavens and the earth, He follows that by mentioning the creation of man. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَبَدَأَ خَلْقَ الإِنْسَـنِ مِن طِينٍ</div><p>(and He began the creation of man from clay.) meaning, He created the father of mankind, Adam, from clay.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ جَعَلَ نَسْلَهُ مِن سُلاَلَةٍ مِّن مَّآءٍ مَّهِينٍ </div><p>(Then He made his offspring from semen of despised water.) means, they reproduce in this fashion, from a Nutfah which comes from the loins of men and from between the ribs of women.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ سَوَّاهُ</div><p>(Then He fashioned him in due proportion,) means, when He created Adam from clay, He created him and gave him shape and made him upright.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنَفَخَ فِيهِ مِن رُّوحِهِ وَجَعَلَ لَكُمُ السَّمْعَ وَالاٌّبْصَـرَ وَالاٌّفْئِدَةَ</div><p>(and breathed into him the soul; and He gave you hearing, sight and the sense of deduction.) means, reason.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَلِيلاً مَّا تَشْكُرُونَ</div><p>(Little is the thanks you give!) means, for these strengths with which Allah has provided you; the one who is truly blessed is the one who uses them to worship and obey his Lord, may He be exalted and glorified.</p>"
