    "text": "<h2>The Reward of the Righteous Believers</h2><p>Allah tells us about His blessed servants, those who believed in Allah and His Messengers and accepted as truth what the Messengers brought. He tells us that they will have the Gardens of Al-Firdaws (Paradise). Abu Umamah said, \"Al-Firdaws is the center of Paradise.\" Qatadah said, \"Al-Firdaws is a hill in Paradise, at its center, the best of it.\" This was also narrated from Samurah and attributed to the Prophet ,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«الْفِرْدَوْسُ رَبْوَةُ الْجَنَّةِ أَوْسَطُهَا وَأَحْسَنُهَا»</div><p>(Al-Firdaws is a hill in Paradise, at its center, the best of it.) A similar report was narrated from Qatadah from Anas bin Malik, and attributed to the Prophet . All of the preceding reports were narrated by Ibn Jarir, may Allah have mercy on him. The following is in the Sahih,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِذَا سَأَلْتُمُ اللهَ الْجَنَّةَ، فَاسْأَلُوهُ الْفِرْدَوْسَ فَإِنَّهُ أَعْلَى الْجَنَّةِ وَأَوْسَطُ الْجَنَّةِ، وَمِنْهُ تَفَجَّرُ أَنْهَارُ الْجَنَّة»</div><p>(If you ask Allah for Paradise, then ask Him for Al-Firdaws, for it is the highest part of Paradise, in the middle of Paradise, and from it spring the rivers of Paradise.)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">نُزُلاً</div><p>(entertainment) means offered to them as hospitality.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَآ</div><p>(Wherein they shall dwell (forever).) means, they will stay there and never leave.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ يَبْغُونَ عَنْهَا حِوَلاً</div><p>(No desire will they have for removal therefrom. ) means, they will never choose or want anything else. This Ayah tells us how much they love and desire it, even though one might imagine that a person who is to stay in one place forever would get tired and bored of it. But Allah tells us that despite this eternal stay, they will never choose to change or move from where they are.</p>"
