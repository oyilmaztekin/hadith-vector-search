    "text": "<h2>Ten Commandments</h2><p>Dawud Al-Awdy narrated that, Ash-Sha`bi said that, `Alqamah said that Ibn Mas`ud said, \"Whoever wishes to read the will and testament of the Messenger of Allah on which he placed his seal, let him read these Ayat,</p><p>قُلْ تَعَالَوْاْ أَتْلُ مَا حَرَّمَ رَبُّكُمْ عَلَيْكُمْ أَلاَّ تُشْرِكُواْ بِهِ شَيْئاً</p><p>(Say: \"Come, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited you from: Join not anything in worship with Him...\") until,</p><p>لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ</p><p>(...so that you may have Taqwa) 6:153.\" In his Mustadrak, Al-Hakim recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, \"In Surah Al-An`am 6, there are clear Ayat, and they are the Mother of the Book (the Qur'an).\" He then recited,</p><p>قُلْ تَعَالَوْاْ أَتْلُ مَا حَرَّمَ رَبُّكُمْ عَلَيْكُمْ</p><p>(Say: \"Come, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited you from...\") Al-Hakim said, \"Its chain is Sahih, and they did not record it.\" In his Mustadrak Al-Hakim also recorded that `Ubadah bin As-Samit said, \"The Messenger of Allah said,</p><p>«أَيُّكُمْ يُبَايِعُنِي عَلَى ثَلَاث»</p><p>(Who among you will give me his pledge to do three things) He then recited the Ayah,</p><p>قُلْ تَعَالَوْاْ أَتْلُ مَا حَرَّمَ رَبُّكُمْ عَلَيْكُمْ</p><p>(Say: \"Come, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited you from...\") until the end of the Ayat. He then said,</p><p>«فَمَنْ وَفَى فَأَجْرُهُ عَلَى اللهِ وَمَنِ انْتَقَصَ مِنْهُنَّ شَيْئًا فَأَدْرَكَهُ اللهُ بِهِ فِي الدُّنْيَا كَانَتْ عُقُوبَتهُ، وَمَنْ أَخَّرَ إِلَى الْآخِرَةِ فَأَمْرُهُ إِلَى اللهِ إِنْ شَاءَ عَذَّبَهُ وَإِنْ شَاءَ عَفَا عَنْه»</p><p>(Whoever fulfills (this pledge), then his reward will be with Allah, but whoever fell into shortcomings and Allah punishes him for it in this life, then that will be his recompense. Whoever Allah delays (his reckoning) until the Hereafter, then his matter is with Allah. If He wills, He will punish him, and if He wills, He will forgive him.)\" Al-Hakim said, \"Its chain is Sahih and they did not record it.\" As for the explanation of this Ayah, Allah said to His Prophet and Messenger Muhammad ﷺ: Say, O Muhammad, to those idolators who worshipped other than Allah, forbade what Allah provided them with and killed their children, following their opinions and the lures of the devils,'</p><p>قُلْ</p><p>(Say) to them</p><p>تَعَالَوْاْ</p><p>(Come) come here, come close</p><p>أَتْلُ مَا حَرَّمَ رَبُّكُمْ عَلَيْكُمْ</p><p>(I will recite what your Lord has prohibited you from. ) meaning, I will inform you about what your Lord has forbidden for you in truth, not guessing or wishful thinking. Rather, it is revelation and an order from Him.</p><h2>Shirk is Forbidden</h2><p>أَلاَّ تُشْرِكُواْ بِهِ شَيْئاً</p><p>(Join not anything in worship with Him;) this Allah has ordained, for He said at the end of the Ayah,</p><p>ذلِكُمْ وَصَّـكُمْ بِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ</p><p>(This He has commanded you that you may understand.) In the the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that Abu Dharr said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«أَتَانِي جِبْرِيلُ فَبَشَّرَنِي أَنَّهُ مَنْ مَاتَ لَا يُشْرِكُ بِاللهِ شَيْئًا مِنْ أُمَّتِكَ دَخَلَ الْجَنَّةَ، قُلْتُ وَإِنْ زَنَى وَإِنْ سَرَقَ؟ قَالَ: وَإِنْ زَنَى وَإِنْ سَرَقَ، قُلْتُ: وَإِنْ زَنَى وَإِنْ سَرَقَ؟ قَالَ: وَإِنْ زَنَى وَإِنْ سَرَقَ، قُلْت: وَإِنْ زَنَى وَإِنْ سَرَقَ؟ قَالَ: وَإِنْ زَنَى وَإِنْ سَرَقَ وَإِنْ شَرِبَ الْخَمْر»</p><p>(Jibril came to me and conveyed the good news that, \"Whoever among your followers dies, worshipping none along with Allah, will enter Paradise.\" I said, \"Even if he stole or committed illegal sexual intercourse\" He said, \"Even if he stole or committed illegal sexual intercourse.\" I said, \"Even if he stole or committed illegal sexual intercourse\" He said, \"Even if he stole or committed illegal sexual intercourse.\" I said, \"Even if he stole or committed illegal sexual intercourse\" He said, \"Even if he stole or committed illegal sexual intercourse or even if drank alcohol.\") Some of the Musnad and Sunan compilers recorded that Abu Dharr said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«يَقُولُ تَعَالَى: يَا ابْنَ آدَمَ إِنَّكَ مَا دَعَوْتَنِي وَرَجَوْتَنِي فَإِنِّي أَغْفِرُ لَكَ عَلَى مَا كَانَ مِنْكَ وَلَا أُبَالِي،وَلَوْ أَتَيْتَنِي بِقُرَابِ الْأَرْضِ خَطِيئَةً أَتَيْتُكَ بِقُرَابِهَا مَغْفِرَةً مَا لَمْ تُشْرِكْ بِي شَيْئًا، وَإِنْ أَخْطَأْتَ حَتَّى تَبْلُغَ خَطَاَياكَ عَنَانَ السَّمَاءِ ثُمَّ اسْتَغْفَرْتَنِي غَفَرْتُ لَك»</p><p>(Allah said, `O Son of Adam! As long as you supplicate to Me and hope of Me, I will forgive whatever you committed, and it will be easy for Me to do that. And even if you brought the earth's fill of sins to Me, I will bring forth its fill of forgiveness, as long as you do not associate anything or anyone in worship with Me. And even if you err and your errors accumulate until they reach the boundaries of the sky and you then ask Me for forgiveness, I will forgive you.') This subject is also mentioned in the Qur'an, for Allah said,</p><p>إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَلِكَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ</p><p>(Verily, Allah forgives not (the sin of) setting up partners (in worship) with Him, but He forgives whom He wills, sins other than that.) 4:116 Muslim recorded a Hadith in the Sahih that reads,</p><p>«مَنْ مَاتَ لَا يُشْرِكُ بِاللهِ شَيْئًا دَخَلَ الْجَنَّـة»</p><p>(Whoever dies associating none with Allah will enter Paradise.) There are many Ayat and Hadiths on this subject.</p><h2>The Order for Kindness to Parents</h2><p>Allah said next,</p><p>وَبِالْوَلِدَيْنِ إِحْسَانًا</p><p>(be kind and dutiful to your parents;) meaning, Allah has commanded and ordered you to be kind to your parents. Allah said in another Ayah,</p><p>وَقَضَى رَبُّكَ أَلاَّ تَعْبُدُواْ إِلاَّ إِيَّـهُ وَبِالْوَلِدَيْنِ إِحْسَـناً</p><p>(And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And that you be dutiful to your parents.) 17:23 Allah often mentions obeying Him and being dutiful to parents together. Allah said,</p><p>وَوَصَّيْنَا الإِنْسَـنَ بِوَلِدَيْهِ حَمَلَتْهُ أُمُّهُ وَهْناً عَلَى وَهْنٍ وَفِصَالُهُ فِى عَامَيْنِ أَنِ اشْكُرْ لِى وَلِوَلِدَيْكَ إِلَىَّ الْمَصِيرُ - وَإِن جَـهَدَاكَ عَلَى أَن تُشْرِكَ بِى مَا لَيْسَ لَكَ بِهِ عِلْمٌ فَلاَ تُطِعْهُمَا وَصَـحِبْهُمَا فِى الدُّنْيَا مَعْرُوفاً وَاتَّبِعْ سَبِيلَ مَنْ أَنَابَ إِلَىَّ ثُمَّ إِلَىَّ مَرْجِعُكُمْ فَأُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(Give thanks to Me and to your parents. Unto Me is the final destination. But if they (both) strive with you to make you join in worship with Me others that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not; but behave with them in this world kindly, and follow the path of him who turns to Me in repentance and in obedience. Then to Me will be your return, and I shall tell you what you used to do.) 31:14-15 Therefore, Allah ordered children to be dutiful and kind to their parents, even if they were idolators. Allah also said,</p><p>وَإِذْ أَخَذْنَا مِيثَـقَ بَنِى إِسْرءِيلَ لاَ تَعْبُدُونَ إِلاَّ اللَّهَ وَبِالْوَلِدَيْنِ إِحْسَانًا</p><p>(And (remember) when We took a covenant from the Children of Israel, (saying): Worship none but Allah and be dutiful and kind to parents.) 2:83 There are several Ayat on this subject. It is recorded in the Two Sahihs that Ibn Mas`ud said, \"I asked Allah's Messenger ﷺ about which deed is the best. He said,</p><p>«الصَّلَاةُ عَلَى وَقْتِهَا»</p><p>(The prayer, when it is performed on time.) I said, `Then' He said,</p><p>«بِرُّ الْوَالِدَيْن»</p><p>(Being dutiful to parents.) I asked, `Then' He said,</p><p>«الْجِهَادُ فِي سَبِيلِ الله»</p><p>(Jihad in Allah's cause.) Ibn Mas`ud said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said these words to me, and had I asked him for more, he would have said more.\"</p><h2>Killing Children is Forbidden</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَلاَ تَقْتُلُواْ أَوْلَـدَكُمْ مِّنْ إمْلَـقٍ نَّحْنُ نَرْزُقُكُمْ وَإِيَّاهُمْ</p><p>(Kill not your children because of poverty, We shall provide sustenance for you and for them.) After Allah commanded kindness to parents and grandparents, He next ordered kindness to children and grandchildren. Allah said,</p><p>وَلاَ تَقْتُلُواْ أَوْلَـدَكُمْ مِّنْ إمْلَـقٍ</p><p>(kill not your children because of poverty,) because the idolators used to kill their children, obeying the lures of the devils. They used to bury their daughters alive for fear of shame, and sometimes kill their sons for fear of poverty. It is recorded in the Two Sahihs that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, \"I asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, `Which sin is the biggest' He said,</p><p>«أَنْ تَجْعَلَ للهِ نِدًّا وَهُوَ خَلَقَك»</p><p>(To call a rival for Allah, while He Alone created you.) I said, `Then what' He said,</p><p>«أَنْ تَقْتُلَ وَلَدَكَ خَشْيَةَ أَنْ يَطْعَمَ مَعَك»</p><p>(To kill your son for fear that he might share your food.') I said, `Then what' He said,</p><p>«أَنْ تُزَانِي حَلِيلَةَ جَارِك»</p><p>(To commit adultery with your neighbor's wife.) Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited the Ayah,</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ لاَ يَدْعُونَ مَعَ اللَّهِ إِلَـهَا ءَاخَرَ وَلاَ يَقْتُلُونَ النَّفْسَ الَّتِى حَرَّمَ اللَّهُ إِلاَّ بِالْحَقِّ وَلاَ يَزْنُونَ</p><p>(And those who invoke not any other god along with Allah, nor kill such person as Allah has forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse...) 25:68.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>مِّنْ إمْلَـقٍ</p><p>(Because of Imlaq) refers to poverty, according to Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others. The Ayah means, do not kill your children because you are poor. Allah said in Surat Al-Isra',</p><p>وَلاَ تَقْتُلُواْ أَوْلادَكُمْ خَشْيَةَ إِمْلَـقٍ</p><p>(And do not kill your children for fear from Imlaq.) 17:31, that is, do not kill your children for fear that you might become poor in the future. This is why Allah said,</p><p>نَّحْنُ نَرْزُقُهُمْ وَإِيَّاكُم</p><p>(We shall provide sustenance for them and for you) 17:31, thus mentioning the provision of the children first, meaning, do not fear poverty because of feeding your children. Certainly, their provision is provided by Allah. Allah said,</p><p>نَّحْنُ نَرْزُقُكُمْ وَإِيَّاهُمْ</p><p>(We provide sustenance for you and for them,) thus starting with parents, because this is the appropriate subject here and Allah knows. Allah said next,</p><p>وَلاَ تَقْرَبُواْ الْفَوَحِشَ مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا وَمَا بَطَنَ</p><p>(Come not near Al-Fawahish (immoral sins) whether committed openly or secretly) Allah said in a similar Ayah,</p><p>قُلْ إِنَّمَا حَرَّمَ رَبِّيَ الْفَوَحِشَ مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا وَمَا بَطَنَ وَالإِثْمَ وَالْبَغْىَ بِغَيْرِ الْحَقِّ وَأَن تُشْرِكُواْ بِاللَّهِ مَا لَمْ يُنَزِّلْ بِهِ سُلْطَـناً وَأَن تَقُولُواْ عَلَى اللَّهِ مَا لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ</p><p>(Say: \"(But) the things that my Lord has indeed forbidden are Al-Fawahish (immoral sins) whether committed openly or secretly, sins (of all kinds), unrighteous oppression, joining partners (in worship) with Allah for which He has given no authority, and saying things about Allah of which you have no knowledge.\") 7:33 We also explained this meaning in the explanation of the Ayah,</p><p>وَذَرُواْ ظَـهِرَ الإِثْمِ وَبَاطِنَهُ</p><p>(Leave sin, open and secret) 6:120. The Two Sahihs recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَا أَحَدٌ أَغْيَرَ مِنَ اللهِ، مِنْ أَجْلِ ذَلِكَ حَرَّمَ الْفَوَاحِشَ مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا وَمَا بَطَن»</p><p>(None is more jealous than Allah. This is why He has forbidden the immoral sins committed openly or secretly.) `Abdul-Malik bin `Umayr said that Warrad narrated that Al-Mughirah said that Sa`d bin `Ubadah said, \"If I see a man with my wife (committing adultery), I will kill him with the sword.\" When the matter came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, he said,</p><p>«أَتَعْجَبُونَ مِنْ غَيْرةِ سَعْدٍ؟ فَوَاللهِ لَأَنَا أَغْيَرُ مِنْ سَعْدٍ، وَاللهُ أَغْيَرُ مِنِّي، مِنْ أَجْلِ ذَلِكَ حَرَّمَ الْفَوَاحِشَ مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا وَمَا بَطَن»</p><p>(Do you wonder at Sa`d's jealousy By Allah, I am more jealous than Sa`d, and Allah is more jealous than I. This is why He has forbidden the immoral sins committed openly and in secret.) This Hadith is in the Two Sahihs).</p><h2>The Prohibition of Unjustified Killing</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَلاَ تَقْتُلُواْ النَّفْسَ الَّتِى حَرَّمَ اللَّهُ إِلاَّ بِالْحَقِّ</p><p>(And kill not anyone whom Allah has forbidden, except for a just cause (according to Islamic law).) This part of the Ayah emphasizes this prohibition in specific, although it is included in the immoral sins committed openly and in secret. In the Two Sahihs, it is recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَا يَحِلُّ دَمُ امْرِىءٍ مُسْلِمٍ يَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ وَأَنِّي رَسُولُ اللهِ، إِلَّا بِإِحْدَى ثَلَاثٍ: الثَّيِّبُ الزَّانِي، وَالنَّفْسُ بِالنَّفْسِ، وَالتَّارِكُ لِدِينِهِ الْمُفَارِقُ لِلْجَمَاعَة»</p><p>(The blood of a Muslim person who testifies that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah and that I am the Messenger of Allah ﷺ is prohibited, except for three offenses: a married person who commits illegal sexual intercourse, life for life, and whoever reverts from the religion and abandons the Jama`ah (the community of faithful believers).) There is a prohibition, a warning and a threat against killing the Mu`ahid, i.e., non-Muslims who have a treaty of peace with Muslims. Al-Bukhari recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said that the Prophet said,</p><p>«مَنْ قَتَلَ مُعَاهِدًا لَمْ يَرَحْ رَائِحَةَ الْجَنَّةِ، وَإِنَّ رِيحَهَا لَيُوجَدُ مِنْ مَسِيرَةِ أَرْبَعِينَ عَامًّا»</p><p>(Whoever killed a person having a treaty of protection with Muslims, shall not smell the scent of Paradise, though its scent is perceived from a distance of forty years. ) Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet said,</p><p>«مَنْ قَتَلَ مُعَاهِدًا لَهُ ذِمَّةُ اللهِ وَذِمَّةُ رَسُولِهِ فَقَدْ أَخْفَرَ بِذِمَّةِ اللهِ، فَلَا يَرَحْ رَائِحَةَ الْجَنَّةِ، وَإِنَّ رِيحَهَا لَيُوجَدُ مِنْ مَسِيرَةِ سَبْعِينَ خَرِيفًا»</p><p>(Whoever killed a person having a treaty of protection with the Muslims, and who enjoys the guarantee of Allah and His Messenger, he will have spoiled the guarantee of Allah for him. He shall not smell the scent of Paradise though its smell is perceived from a distance of seventy years.) Ibn Majah and At-Tirmidhi recorded this Hadith, and At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Sahih.\" Allah's statement,</p><p>ذلِكُمْ وَصَّـكُمْ بِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ</p><p>(This He has commanded you that you may understand.) means, this is what He has commanded you that you may comprehend His commandments and prohibitions.</p>"
