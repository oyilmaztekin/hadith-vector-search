Verily, Allah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allah has set a measure for all things) 65:3.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يُحِبُّ كُلَّ خَوَّانٍ كَفُورٍ</div><p>(Verily, Allah likes not any treacherous ingrate) means, He does not like any of His servants who bear these characteristics, i.e., treachery in covenants and promises whereby a person does not do what he says, and ingratitude is to deny the blessings, whereby one does not acknowledge or appreciate them.</p>"
