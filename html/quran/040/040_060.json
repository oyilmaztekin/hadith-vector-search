    "text": "<h2>The Command to call upon Allah By His grace and kindness,</h2><p>Allah encourages His servants to call upon Him, and He guarantees to respond. Sufyan Ath-Thawri used to say: \"O You Who love most those who ask of You, and O You Who hate most those who do not ask of You, and there is no one like that apart from You, O Lord.\" This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim. Similarly; the poet said: \"Allah hates not to be asked, and the son of Adam hates to be asked.\" Qatadah said that Ka`b Al-Ahbar said, \"This Ummah has been given three things which were not given to any nation before, only to Prophets. When Allah sent a Prophet, He said to him, `You are a witness over your nation.' But you have been made witnesses over mankind; it was said to the Prophets individually, `Allah has not laid upon you any hardship in religion,' but He said to this entire Ummah:</p><p>وَمَا جَعَلَ عَلَيْكمْ فِى الدِّينِ مِنْ حَرَجٍ</p><p>(and Allah has not laid upon you in religion any hardship) (22:78) and it was said to the Prophets individually; `Call upon Me, I will answer you,' but it was said to this Ummah,</p><p>ادْعُونِى أَسْتَجِبْ لَكُمْ</p><p>(Call upon Me, I will answer you).\" This was recorded by Ibn Abi Hatim. Imam Ahmad recorded that Al-Nu`man bin Bashir, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِنَّ الدُّعَاءَ هُوَ الْعِبَادَة»</p><p>l(Indeed the supplication is the worship. )\" Then he recited,</p><p>ادْعُونِى أَسْتَجِبْ لَكُمْ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِى سَيَدْخُلُونَ جَهَنَّمَ دَخِرِينَ</p><p>(And your Lord said: \"Call upon Me, I will answer you. Verily, those who scorn My worship they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!\"). This was also recorded by the Sunan compilers; At-Tirmdhi, An-Nasa'i, Ibn Majah, and Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Jarir. At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Sahih.\" It was also recorded by Abu Dawud, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i, and Ibn Jarir with a different chain of narration. Allah's saying:</p><p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِى</p><p>(Verily, those who scorn My worship) means, `those who are too proud to call on Me and single Me out,'</p><p>سَيَدْخُلُونَ جَهَنَّمَ دَخِرِينَ</p><p>(they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!) means, in disgrace and insignificance. Imam Ahmad recorded from `Amr bin Shu`ayb from his father, from his grandfather that the Prophet said:</p><p>«يُحْشَرُ الْمُتَكَبِّرُونَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ أَمْثَالَ الذَّرِّ فِي صُوَرِ النَّاسِ، يَعْلُوهُمْ كُلُّ شَيْءٍ مِنَ الصَّغَارِ، حَتْى يَدْخُلُوا سِجْنًا فِي جَهَنَّمَ يُقَالُ لَهُ: بُولَسُ، تَعْلُوهُمْ نَارُ الْأنْيَارِ، يُسْقَوْنَ مِنْ طِينَةِ الْخَبَالِ، عُصَارَةِ أَهْلِ النَّار»</p><p>(The proud will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection like ants in the image of people, and everything will be stepping on them, humiliating them, until they enter a prison in Hell called Bulas. They will be fed flames of fire, and given for drink a paste of insanity dripping from the people the Fire.)\"</p>"
