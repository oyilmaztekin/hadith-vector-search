    "text": "<h2>The Stubborn Disbelievers will never believe, no matter what Signs and Wonders They see</h2><p>Allah explains the extent of their disbelief and stubborn resistance to the truth by stating that even if a door to heaven were to be opened for them, and they were to be taken up through it, they would still not believe. Rather, they would say:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّمَا سُكِّرَتْ أَبْصَـرُنَا</div><p>(Our eyes have been (as if) dazzled.) Mujahid, Ibn Kathir and Ad-Dahhak said, \"this means our vision has been blocked.\" Qatadah narrated that Ibn `Abbas said, \"this means our eyesight has been taken away.\" Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"this means we were confused and put under a spell.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سُكِّرَتْ أَبْصَـرُنَا</div><p>(Our eyes have been (as if) dazzled.) Ibn Zayd said: \"The one who is dazzled lit. intoxicated is the one who cannot reason.\"</p>"
