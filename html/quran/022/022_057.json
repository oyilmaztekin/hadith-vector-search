    "text": "<h2>The Disbelievers will remain in Doubt and Confusion</h2><p>Allah tells us that the disbelievers will remain in doubt concerning this Qur'an. This was the view of Ibn Jurayj and was the view favored by Ibn Jarir.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَتَّى تَأْتِيَهُمُ السَّاعَةُ بَغْتَةً</div><p>(until the Hour comes suddenly upon them,) Mujahid said: \"By surprise.\" Qatadah said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَغْتَةً</div><p>(suddenly) means, the command of Allah will catch the people unaware. Allah never seizes a people except when they are intoxicated with pride, enjoying a life of luxury, and they think that the punishment will never come upon them, but Allah does not punish anyone except the evildoers.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ يَأْتِيَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمٍ عَقِيمٍ</div><p>(or there comes to them the torment of Yawm `Aqim.) Mujahid said, \"Ubay bin Ka`b said: `Yawm `Aqim means the day of Badr.\"' `Ikrimah and Mujahid said: \"Yawm `Aqim means the Day of Resurrection, following which there will be no night.\" This was also the view of Ad-Dahhak and Al-Hasan Al-Basri. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الْمُلْكُ يَوْمَئِذٍ للَّهِ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَهُمْ</div><p>(The sovereignty on that Day will be that of Allah. He will judge between them.) This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَـلِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ </div><p>(The Only Owner of the Day of Recompense) 1:4</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الْمُلْكُ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْحَقُّ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَكَانَ يَوْماً عَلَى الْكَـفِرِينَ عَسِيراً </div><p>(The sovereignty on that Day will be the true (sovereignty), belonging to the Most Gracious (Allah), and it will be a hard Day for the disbelievers.) 25:26</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ</div><p>(So those who believed and did righteous good deeds) means, their hearts believed in Allah and His Messenger , and they acted in accor- dance with what they knew; their words and deeds were in harmony.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فِى جَنَّـتِ النَّعِيمِ </div><p>(in Gardens of Delight.) means, they will enjoy eternal bliss which will never end or fade away.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَكَذَّبُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَآ</div><p>(And those who disbelieved and denied Our Ayat,) means, their hearts rejected and denied the truth; they disbelieved in it and resisted the Messengers and were too proud to follow them. e</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأُوْلَـئِكَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ مُّهِينٌ</div><p>(for them will be a humiliating torment. ) means, in recompense for arrogantly turning away from the truth.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِى سَيَدْخُلُونَ جَهَنَّمَ دَخِرِينَ</div><p>(Verily, those who scorn My worship they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!) 40:60</p>"
