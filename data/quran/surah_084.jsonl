There are some people who refer the pronoun back to the statement \"your Lord.\" Thus, they hold the Ayah to mean, \"and you will meet your Lord.\" This means that He will reward you for your work, and pay you for your efforts. Therefore, both of these two views are connected. Al-`Awfi recorded from Ibn `Abbas that he said explaining,\nيأَيُّهَا الإِنسَـنُ إِنَّكَ كَادِحٌ إِلَى رَبِّكَ كَدْحاً\n(O man! Verily, you are returning towards your Lord with your deeds and actions, a sure returning,) \"Whatever deed you do, you will meet Allah with it, whether it is good or bad.\"\nThe Presentation and the Discussion that will take place during the Reckoning\nThen Allah says,\nفَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِىَ كِتَـبَهُ بِيَمِينِهِ - فَسَوْفَ يُحَاسَبُ حِسَاباً يَسِيراً\n(Then as for him who will be given his Record in his right hand, he surely, will receive an easy reckoning,) (84:7-8) meaning, easy without any difficulty. This means that he will not be investigated for all the minute details of his deeds. For verily, whoever is reckoned like that, he will certainly be destroyed. Imam Ahmad recorded from `A'ishah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«مَنْ نُوقِشَ الْحِسَابَ عُذِّب»\n(Whoever is interrogated during the reckoning, then he will be punished.) `A'ishah then said, \"But didn't Allah say,\nفَسَوْفَ يُحَاسَبُ حِسَاباً يَسِيراً\n(He surely will receive an easy reckoning,)\" The Prophet replied,\n«لَيْسَ ذَاكِ بِالْحِسَابِ، وَلَــكِنْ ذلِكِ الْعَرْضُ، مَنْ نُوقِشَ الْحِسَابَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ عُذِّب»\n(That is not during to the Reckoning, rather it is referring to the presentation. Whoever is interrogated during the Reckoning on the Day of Judgement, then he will be punished.) This Hadith has also been recorded by Al-Bukhari, Muslim, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Jarir. In reference to Allah's statement,\nوَيَنقَلِبُ إِلَى أَهْلِهِ مَسْرُوراً\n(And will return to his family Masrur!) This means that he will return to his family in Paradise. This was said by Qatadah and Ad-Dahhak. They also said, \"Masrur means happy and delighted by what Allah has given him.\" Allah said;\nوَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِىَ كِتَـبَهُ وَرَآءَ ظَهْرِهِ\n(But whosoever is given his Record behind his back,) meaning, he will be given his Book in his left hand, behind his back, while his hand is bent behind him.\nفَسَوْفَ يَدْعُو ثُبُوراً\n(He will invoke destruction,) meaning, loss and destruction.\nوَيَصْلَى سَعِيراً - إِنَّهُ كَانَ فِى أَهْلِهِ مَسْرُوراً\n(And he shall enter a blazing Fire, and made to taste its burning.

His light happiness will be followed by long grief.\nإِنَّهُ ظَنَّ أَن لَّن يَحُورَ\n(Verily, he thought that he would never return!) meaning, he used to believe that he would not return to Allah, nor would Allah bring him back (to life) after his death. This was said by Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah and others. Allah then says,\nبَلَى إِنَّ رَبَّهُ كَانَ بِهِ بَصِيراً\n(Yes! Verily, his Lord has been ever beholding him!) meaning, certainly Allah will repeat his creation just as he began his creation, and He will reward him based upon his deeds, whether they were good or bad.

Then when he completed the prayer, he informed them that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ prostrated during its recitation. This was recorded by Muslim and An-Nasa'i on the authority of Malik.

Verily, you are returning towards your Lord with your deeds and actions, a sure returning,) \"Whatever deed you do, you will meet Allah with it, whether it is good or bad.\"\nThe Presentation and the Discussion that will take place during the Reckoning\nThen Allah says,\nفَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِىَ كِتَـبَهُ بِيَمِينِهِ - فَسَوْفَ يُحَاسَبُ حِسَاباً يَسِيراً\n(Then as for him who will be given his Record in his right hand, he surely, will receive an easy reckoning,) (84:7-8) meaning, easy without any difficulty. This means that he will not be investigated for all the minute details of his deeds. For verily, whoever is reckoned like that, he will certainly be destroyed. Imam Ahmad recorded from `A'ishah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«مَنْ نُوقِشَ الْحِسَابَ عُذِّب»\n(Whoever is interrogated during the reckoning, then he will be punished.) `A'ishah then said, \"But didn't Allah say,\nفَسَوْفَ يُحَاسَبُ حِسَاباً يَسِيراً\n(He surely will receive an easy reckoning,)\" The Prophet replied,\n«لَيْسَ ذَاكِ بِالْحِسَابِ، وَلَــكِنْ ذلِكِ الْعَرْضُ، مَنْ نُوقِشَ الْحِسَابَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ عُذِّب»\n(That is not during to the Reckoning, rather it is referring to the presentation. Whoever is interrogated during the Reckoning on the Day of Judgement, then he will be punished.) This Hadith has also been recorded by Al-Bukhari, Muslim, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Jarir. In reference to Allah's statement,\nوَيَنقَلِبُ إِلَى أَهْلِهِ مَسْرُوراً\n(And will return to his family Masrur!) This means that he will return to his family in Paradise. This was said by Qatadah and Ad-Dahhak. They also said, \"Masrur means happy and delighted by what Allah has given him.\" Allah said;\nوَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِىَ كِتَـبَهُ وَرَآءَ ظَهْرِهِ\n(But whosoever is given his Record behind his back,) meaning, he will be given his Book in his left hand, behind his back, while his hand is bent behind him.\nفَسَوْفَ يَدْعُو ثُبُوراً\n(He will invoke destruction,) meaning, loss and destruction.\nوَيَصْلَى سَعِيراً - إِنَّهُ كَانَ فِى أَهْلِهِ مَسْرُوراً\n(And he shall enter a blazing Fire, and made to taste its burning. Verily, he was among his people in joy!) meaning, happy. He did not think about the consequences, nor feared what (future) was in front of him. His light happiness will be followed by long grief.\nإِنَّهُ ظَنَّ أَن لَّن يَحُورَ\n(Verily, he thought that he would never return!) meaning, he used to believe that he would not return to Allah, nor would Allah bring him back (to life) after his death. This was said by Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah and others. Allah then says,\nبَلَى إِنَّ رَبَّهُ كَانَ بِهِ بَصِيراً\n(Yes! Verily, his Lord has been ever beholding him!) meaning, certainly Allah will repeat his creation just as he began his creation, and He will reward him based upon his deeds, whether they were good or bad.

Abu Hurayrah replied, \"I prostrated behind Abul-Qasim (the Prophet ), and I will never cease prostrating during its recitation until I meet him.\"\nبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nSplitting the Heavens asunder and stretching the Earth forth on the Day of Resurrection\nAllah says,\nإِذَا السَّمَآءُ انشَقَّتْ\n(When the heaven is split asunder,) This refers to the Day of Judgement.\nوَأَذِنَتْ لِرَبِّهَا\n(And listens to and obeys its Lord) meaning, it listens to its Lord and obeys His command to split apart. This will occur on the Day of Judgement.\nوَحُقَّتْ\n(and it must do so.) meaning, it is right for it to obey the command of its Lord, because it is great and cannot be rejected, nor overcome. Rather it overpowers everything and everything is submissive to it. Then Allah says,\nوَإِذَا الاٌّرْضُ مُدَّتْ\n(And when the earth is stretched forth,) meaning, when the earth is expanded, spread out and extended. Then He says,\nوَأَلْقَتْ مَا فِيهَا وَتَخَلَّتْ\n(And has cast out all that was in it and became empty.) meaning, it throws out the dead inside of it, and it empties itself of them. This was said by Mujahid, Sa`id, and Qatadah.\nوَأَذِنَتْ لِرَبِّهَا وَحُقَّتْ\n(And listens to and obeys its Lord, and it must do so.) The explanation of this is the same as what has preceded.\nThe Recompense for Deeds is True\nAllah says,\nيأَيُّهَا الإِنسَـنُ إِنَّكَ كَادِحٌ إِلَى رَبِّكَ كَدْحاً\n(O man! Verily, you are returning towards your Lord with your deeds and actions, a sure returning,) meaning, `verily you are hastening to your Lord and working deeds.'\nفَمُلَـقِيهِ\n(and you will meet.) `Then you will meet that which you did of good or evil.' A proof for this is what Abu Dawud At-Tayalisi recorded from Jabir, that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«قَالَ جِبْرِيلُ: يَا مُحَمَّدُ، عِشْ مَا شِئْتَ فَإِنَّكَ مَيِّتٌ، وَأَحْبِبْ (مَنْ) شِئْتَ فَإِنَّكَ مُفَارِقُهُ، وَاعْمَلْ مَا شِئْتَ فَإِنَّكَ مُلَاقِيه»\n(Jibril said, \"O Muhammad! Live how you wish, for verily you will die; love what you wish, for verily you will part with it; and do what you wish, for verily you will meet it (your deed).) There are some people who refer the pronoun back to the statement \"your Lord.\" Thus, they hold the Ayah to mean, \"and you will meet your Lord.\" This means that He will reward you for your work, and pay you for your efforts. Therefore, both of these two views are connected. Al-`Awfi recorded from Ibn `Abbas that he said explaining,\nيأَيُّهَا الإِنسَـنُ إِنَّكَ كَادِحٌ إِلَى رَبِّكَ كَدْحاً\n(O man! Verily, you are returning towards your Lord with your deeds and actions, a sure returning,) \"Whatever deed you do, you will meet Allah with it, whether it is good or bad.\"\nThe Presentation and the Discussion that will take place during the Reckoning\nThen Allah says,\nفَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِىَ كِتَـبَهُ بِيَمِينِهِ - فَسَوْفَ يُحَاسَبُ حِسَاباً يَسِيراً\n(Then as for him who will be given his Record in his right hand, he surely, will receive an easy reckoning,) (84:7-8) meaning, easy without any difficulty. This means that he will not be investigated for all the minute details of his deeds. For verily, whoever is reckoned like that, he will certainly be destroyed. Imam Ahmad recorded from `A'ishah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«مَنْ نُوقِشَ الْحِسَابَ عُذِّب»\n(Whoever is interrogated during the reckoning, then he will be punished.) `A'ishah then said, \"But didn't Allah say,\nفَسَوْفَ يُحَاسَبُ حِسَاباً يَسِيراً\n(He surely will receive an easy reckoning,)\" The Prophet replied,\n«لَيْسَ ذَاكِ بِالْحِسَابِ، وَلَــكِنْ ذلِكِ الْعَرْضُ، مَنْ نُوقِشَ الْحِسَابَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ عُذِّب»\n(That is not during to the Reckoning, rather it is referring to the presentation. Whoever is interrogated during the Reckoning on the Day of Judgement, then he will be punished.) This Hadith has also been recorded by Al-Bukhari, Muslim, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i and Ibn Jarir. In reference to Allah's statement,\nوَيَنقَلِبُ إِلَى أَهْلِهِ مَسْرُوراً\n(And will return to his family Masrur!) This means that he will return to his family in Paradise. This was said by Qatadah and Ad-Dahhak. They also said, \"Masrur means happy and delighted by what Allah has given him.\" Allah said;\nوَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِىَ كِتَـبَهُ وَرَآءَ ظَهْرِهِ\n(But whosoever is given his Record behind his back,) meaning, he will be given his Book in his left hand, behind his back, while his hand is bent behind him.\nفَسَوْفَ يَدْعُو ثُبُوراً\n(He will invoke destruction,) meaning, loss and destruction.\nوَيَصْلَى سَعِيراً - إِنَّهُ كَانَ فِى أَهْلِهِ مَسْرُوراً\n(And he shall enter a blazing Fire, and made to taste its burning. Verily, he was among his people in joy!) meaning, happy. He did not think about the consequences, nor feared what (future) was in front of him. His light happiness will be followed by long grief.\nإِنَّهُ ظَنَّ أَن لَّن يَحُورَ\n(Verily, he thought that he would never return!) meaning, he used to believe that he would not return to Allah, nor would Allah bring him back (to life) after his death. This was said by Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah and others. Allah then says,\nبَلَى إِنَّ رَبَّهُ كَانَ بِهِ بَصِيراً\n(Yes! Verily, his Lord has been ever beholding him!) meaning, certainly Allah will repeat his creation just as he began his creation, and He will reward him based upon his deeds, whether they were good or bad. He was ever watchful of him, meaning All-Knowing and All-Aware.", "verse_meta": {}, "text_arabic_simple": "اذا السماء انشقت ١ واذنت لربها وحقت ٢ واذا الارض مدت ٣ والقت ما فيها وتخلت ٤ واذنت لربها وحقت ٥ يا ايها الانسان انك كادح الى ربك كدحا فملاقيه ٦ فاما من اوتي كتابه بيمينه ٧ فسوف يحاسب حسابا يسيرا ٨ وينقلب الى اهله مسرورا ٩ واما من اوتي كتابه وراء ظهره ١٠إِذَا ٱلسَّمَآءُ ٱنشَقَّتْ ١ وَأَذِنَتْ لِرَبِّهَا وَحُقَّتْ ٢ وَإِذَا ٱلْأَرْضُ مُدَّتْ ٣ وَأَلْقَتْ مَا فِيهَا وَتَخَلَّتْ ٤ وَأَذِنَتْ لِرَبِّهَا وَحُقَّتْ ٥ يَـٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلْإِنسَـٰنُ إِنَّكَ كَادِحٌ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ كَدْحًۭا فَمُلَـٰقِيهِ ٦ فَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِىَ كِتَـٰبَهُۥ بِيَمِينِهِۦ ٧ فَسَوْفَ يُحَاسَبُ حِسَابًۭا يَسِيرًۭا ٨ وَيَنقَلِبُ إِلَىٰٓ أَهْلِهِۦ مَسْرُورًۭا ٩ وَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِىَ كِتَـٰبَهُۥ وَرَآءَ ظَهْرِهِۦ", "text_arabic_uthmani": "اذا السماء انشقت ١ واذنت لربها وحقت ٢ واذا الارض مدت ٣ والقت ما فيها وتخلت ٤ واذنت لربها وحقت ٥ يا ايها الانسان انك كادح الى ربك كدحا فملاقيه ٦ فاما من اوتي كتابه بيمينه ٧ فسوف يحاسب حسابا يسيرا ٨ وينقلب الى اهله مسرورا ٩ واما من اوتي كتابه وراء ظهره", "fetched_at": 1761806520.8036869}

Ease after difficulty, difficulty after ease, wealth after poverty, poverty after wealth, health after sickness, and sickness after health.\"\nThe Disapproval of Their Lack of Faith, giving Them Tidings of the Torment, that the Ultimate Pleasl\nAllah said,\nفَمَا لَهُمْ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ - وَإِذَا قُرِىءَ عَلَيْهِمُ الْقُرْءَانُ لاَ يَسْجُدُونَ\n(What is the matter with them, that they believe not And when the Qur'an is recited to them, they fall not prostrate.) meaning, what prevents them from believing in Allah, His Messenger and the Last Day, and what is wrong with them that when Allah's Ayat and His Words are recited to them they do not prostrate due to awe, respect and reverence Concerning Allah's statement,\nبَلِ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ يُكَذِّبُونَ\n(Nay, those who disbelieve deny.) meaning, from their mannerism is rejection, obstinacy, and opposition to the truth.\nوَاللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا يُوعُونَ\n(And Allah knows best what they gather,) Mujahid and Qatadah both said, \"What they conceal in their chests.\"\nفَبَشِّرْهُمْ بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ\n(So, announce to them a painful torment.) meaning, `inform them, O Muhammad, that Allah has prepared for them a painful torment.' Then Allah says,\nإِلاَّ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ\n(Save those who believe and do righteous good deeds,) This is a clear exception meaning, `but those who believe.' This refers to those who believe in their hearts. Then the statement, \"and do righteous good deeds,\" is referring to that which they do with their limbs.\nلَهُمْ أَجْرٌ\n(for them is a reward) meaning, in the abode of the Hereafter.\nغَيْرُ مَمْنُونٍ\n(that will never come to an end.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"Without being decreased.\" Mujahid and Ad-Dahhak both said, \"Without measure.\" The result of their statements is that it (the reward) is without end. This is as Allah says,\nعَطَآءً غَيْرَ مَجْذُوذٍ\n(A gift without an end.) (11:108) As-Suddi said, \"Some of them have said that this means without end and without decrease.\" This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Inshiqaq.
