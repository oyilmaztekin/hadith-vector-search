    "text": "<h2>Allah will definitely help His Messenger</h2><p>Ibn `Abbas said, \"Whoever thinks that Allah will not help Muhammad ﷺ in this world and the Hereafter, let him stretch out a rope</p><p>إِلَى السَّمَآءِ</p><p>(to the ceiling) to the ceiling in his house,</p><p>ثُمَّ لْيَقْطَعْ</p><p>(and let him strangle himself.) let him hang himself with it.\" This was also the view of Mujahid, `Ikrimah, `Ata', Abu Al-Jawza', Qatadah and others. The meaning is: whoever thinks that Allah will not support Muhammad ﷺ and His Book and His Religion, let him go and kill himself if it annoys him so much. For Allah will most certainly help and support him. Allah says:</p><p>إِنَّا لَنَنصُرُ رُسُلَنَا وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا وَيَوْمَ يَقُومُ الاٌّشْهَـدُ</p><p>(Verily, We will indeed make victorious Our Messengers and those who believe in this world's life and on the Day when the witnesses will stand forth.) 40:51. Allah says here:</p><p>فَلْيَنْظُرْ هَلْ يُذْهِبَنَّ كَيْدُهُ مَا يَغِيظُ</p><p>(Then let him see whether his plan will remove that whereat he rages!) As-Suddi said, \"Meaning, in the case of Muhammad \" `Ata' Al-Khurasani said, \"Let him see whether that will cure the rage he feels in his heart.\"</p><p>وَكَذلِكَ أَنزَلْنَـهُ</p><p>(Thus have We sent it down) the Qur'an.</p><p>ءَايَـتٌ بَيِّنَـتٌ</p><p>(as clear Ayat,) clear in its wording and its meaning, evidence from Allah to mankind.</p><p>وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ يَهْدِى مَن يُرِيدُ</p><p>(and surely, Allah guides whom He wills.) He sends astray whomsoever He wills and He guides whomsoever He wills, and He has complete wisdom and definitive proof in doing so.</p><p>لاَ يُسْأَلُ عَمَّا يَفْعَلُ وَهُمْ يُسْـَلُونَ</p><p>(He cannot be questioned about what He does, while they will be questioned.) 21:23. Because of His wisdom, mercy, justice, knowledge, dominion and might, no one can overturn His ruling, and He is swift in bringing to account.</p>"
