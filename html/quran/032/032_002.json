    "text": "<h2>Which was revealed in Al-Madinah</h2><h2>The Virtues of Surah Alif Lam Mim As-Sajdah</h2><p>In the Book of the Friday prayer, Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, \"The Prophet used to recite in Fajr on Fridays:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الم تَنزِيلَ</div><p>(Alif Lam Mim. The revelation of...), As-Sajdah, and</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَلْ أَتَى عَلَى الإِنسَـنِ</div><p>(Has there not been over man...)Al-Insan (76).\" This was also recorded by Muslim. Imam Ahmad recorded that Jabir said, \"The Prophet would never sleep until he recited:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الم تَنزِيلَ</div><p>(Alif Lam Mim. The revelation of...), As-Sajdah, and</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تَبَارَكَ الَّذِى بِيَدِهِ الْمُلْكُ</div><p>(Blessed be He in Whose Hand is the dominion) Al-Mulk (67).\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</div><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>The Qur'an is the Book of Allah in which there is no Doubt</h2><p>We discussed the individual letters at the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah, and there is no need to repeat it here.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تَنزِيلُ الْكِتَـبِ لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهِ</div><p>(The revelation of the Book in which there is no doubt,) means, there is no doubt whatsoever that it has been revealed</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِّن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ</div><p>(from the Lord of all that exists.) Then Allah tells us about the idolators:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ يَقُولُونَ افْتَرَاهُ</div><p>(Or say they: \"He has fabricated it\"): they say, he has fabricated it, i.e., he has made it up by himself.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلْ هُوَ الْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ لِتُنذِرَ قَوْماً مَّآ أَتَـهُم مِّن نَّذِيرٍ مِّن قَبْلِكَ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَهْتَدُونَ</div><p>(Nay, it is the truth from your Lord, so that you may warn a people to whom no warner has come before you, in order that they may be guided.) means, in order that they may follow the truth.</p>"
