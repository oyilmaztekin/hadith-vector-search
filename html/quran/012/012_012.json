    "text": "<h2>Yusuf's Brothers ask for Their Father's Permission to take Yusuf with Them</h2><p>When Yusuf's brothers agreed to take him and throw him down the well, taking the advice of their elder brother Rubil, they went to their father Ya`qub, peace be upon him. They said to him, \"Why is it that you, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ تَأْمَنَّا عَلَى يُوسُفَ وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَنَـصِحُونَ</div><p>(do not trust us with Yusuf though we are indeed his well-wishers).\" They started executing their plan by this introductory statement, even though they really intended its opposite, out of envy towards Yusuf for being loved by his father. They said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَرْسِلْهُ مَعَنَا</div><p>\"(Send him with us) tomorrow so that we all enjoy ourselves and play.\" Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and As-Suddi said similarly. Yusuf's brothers said next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَحَـفِظُونَ</div><p>(and verily, we will take care of him.), we will protect him and ensure his safety for you. </p>"
