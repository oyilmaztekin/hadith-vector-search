    "text": "<h2>The gathering of the People of Paradise, and the exchange between One of Them and His Counterpart in</h2><p>Allah tells us how the people of Paradise will turn to one another, asking one another about their situation, how they were in this world and what they suffered. This is part of their conversation when they get together to converse and drink, sitting on their thrones, servants coming and going, bringing all kinds of good food, drink, clothes and other delights no eye has seen, no ear has heard, never having comprehend the mind of man.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ قَآئِلٌ مِّنْهُمْ إِنِّى كَانَ لِى قَرِينٌ </div><p>(A speaker of them will say: \"Verily, I had a companion...\") Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him said, \"This refers to an idolator man who had a companion among the believers in this world.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَقُولُ أَءِنَّكَ لَمِنَ الْمُصَدِّقِينَ </div><p>(Who used to say: \"Are you among those who believe...\") means, `do you believe in the resurrection after death, and the Reckoning and reward or punishment' He used to say that by way of astonishment, disbelief and stubbornness.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَءِذَا مِتْنَا وَكُنَّا تُرَاباً وَعِظَـماً أَءِنَّا لَمَدِينُونَ </div><p>((That) when we die and become dust and bones, shall we indeed be indebted (Madinun).) Mujahid and As-Suddi said, \"Brought to account.\" Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, and Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi said, \"Rewarded or punished according to our deeds.\" Both views are correct.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ هَلْ أَنتُمْ مُّطَّلِعُونَ </div><p>((The speaker) said: \"Will you look down\") meaning, look over. The believer will say this to his companions among the people of Paradise.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاطَّلَعَ فَرَءَاهُ فِى سَوَآءِ الْجَحِيمِ </div><p>(So he looked down and saw him in the midst of the Fire.) Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Khulayd Al-`Usari, Qatadah, As-Suddi and `Ata' Al-Khurasani said, \"This means, in the middle of Hell.\" Al-Hasan Al-Basri said, \"In the middle of Hell as if he were a burning star.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ تَاللَّهِ إِن كِدتَّ لَتُرْدِينِ </div><p>(He said: \"By Allah!

But He bestowed His grace upon me, had mercy upon me and guided me to faith and to belief in Him Alone.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كُنَّا لِنَهْتَدِىَ لَوْلا أَنْ هَدَانَا اللَّهُ</div><p>(and never could we have found guidance, were it not that Allah had guided us!)

Ibn Jarir said, \"These are the Words of Allah, and it means: for the like of this pleasure and this success, let the workers work in this world, so that they may attain it in the Hereafter.</p><h2>The Story of Two Israelites</h2><p>They mentioned the story of two men among the Children of Israel who were partners and who are included in the meaning of this Ayah. Abu Ja`far bin Jarir recorded that Furat bin Tha`labah Al-Bahrani said concerning the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنِّى كَانَ لِى قَرِينٌ</div><p>(Verily, I had a companion) \"There were two men who were partners and had collected eight thousand Dinars. One of them had a craft and the other did not. The one who had a craft said to the other, `You do not have a craft, so I think I will divide the money with you and leave you.' So he left him. Then the man bought a house, belonging to a king who had died, for the price of one thousand Dinars. He called his companion and showed him the house, saying, `What do you think of this house I bought it for one thousand Dinars.' He said, `How beautiful it is.' When he went out he said, `O Allah, this companion of mine has bought this house for one thousand Dinars; I ask You for one of the houses of Paradise -- and he gave one thousand Dinars in charity.' Then as much time passed as Allah willed should pass. The first man married a woman with a dowry of one thousand Dinars, and invited his companion and made food for him. When he came, he said, `I have married this woman with a dowry of one thousand Dinars.' He replied; `How beautiful this is.' And when he left, he said, `O Lord, my companion has married a woman with a dowry of one thousand Dinars; I ask you for a wife from among Al-Hur Al-`Iyn' -- and he gave one thousand Dinars in charity. Then as much time passed as Allah willed should pass. Then the first man bought two gardens for two thousand Dinars, then he called his companion and showed them to him. He said, `I have bought these two gardens for two thousand Dinars.' He replied, `How beautiful this is.' When he came out, he said, `O Lord, my companion has bought two gardens for two thousand Dinars; I ask you for two gardens in Paradise' -- and he gave two thousand Dinars in charity. Then the angel came to them and took their souls in death. He took the one who had given his money in charity and put him in a house that he liked. There, there was a woman who was so beautiful that the ground shinned under her, then he (the angel) took him to two gardens and gave him other things which are known only to Allah. The man said, `This is like a man who has such and such.' The angel said, `That is exactly what it is; this house, these gardens and this wife are all for you.' The man said, `I had a companion who used to say: Are you among those who believe' It was said to him, `He is in Hell.' He said, `Will you look down' So he looked down and saw him in the midst of Hell. At this, he said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ تَاللَّهِ إِن كِدتَّ لَتُرْدِينِ - وَلَوْلاَ نِعْمَةُ رَبِّى لَكُنتُ مِنَ الْمُحْضَرِينَ </div><p>(By Allah! You have nearly ruined me. Had it not been for the grace of my Lord, I would certainly have been among those brought forth (to Hell).)\"</p>"
