    "text": "<h2>What was said to Her after the Birth</h2><p>Some reciters read the Ayah as,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَنْ تَحْتِهَا</div><p>(Who was below her) Meaning the one who was below her called to her. Others recited it as,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِن تَحْتِهَآ</div><p>(from below her) With the meaning of a preposition (from) instead of a pronoun (who). The scholars of Tafsir have differed over the interpretation of who was calling out. Al-`Awfi and others reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَنَادَاهَا مِن تَحْتِهَآ</div><p>(Then cried unto her from below her,) \"This is referring to Jibrilbecause `Isa did not speak until she brought him to her people.\" Similarly, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Ad-Dahhak, `Amr bin Maymun, As-Suddi and Qatadah all said, \"Verily, this is referring to the angel Jibril.\" This means that he (Jibril) called out to her from the bottom of the valley. Mujahid said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَنَادَاهَا مِن تَحْتِهَآ</div><p>(Then cried unto her from below her,) \"This is referring to `Isa bin Maryam.\" Likewise, `Abdur-Razzaq reported from Ma`mar that Qatadah said that Al-Hasan said, \"This is referring to her son (`Isa).\" This is also one of the two opinions reported from Sa`id bin Jubayr -- that it was her son, `Isa, speaking. Sa`id said, \"Have you not heard Allah saying,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَشَارَتْ إِلَيْهِ</div><p>(Then she pointed to him.) Ibn Zayd and Ibn Jarir preferred this opinion in his Tafsir. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلاَّ تَحْزَنِى</div><p>(Grieve not:) He called to her saying, \"Do not grieve.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَدْ جَعَلَ رَبُّكِ تَحْتَكِ سَرِيّاً</div><p>(your Lord has provided a Sariy under you.) Sufyan Ath-Thawri and Shu`bah reported from Abu Ishaq that Al-Bara' bin `Azib said, s</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَدْ جَعَلَ رَبُّكِ تَحْتَكِ سَرِيّاً</div><p>(your Lord has provided a Sariy under you.) \"This means a small stream.\" Likewise, `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Sariy means a river.\" `Amr bin Maymun held the same view, as he said, \"It means a river for her to drink from.\" Mujahid said, \"It means river in the Syrian language.\" Sa`id bin Jubayr said, \"Sariy is a small flowing river.\" Others said that Sariy refers to `Isa. This was said by Al-Hasan, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, Muhammad bin `Abbad bin Ja`far, and it is one of the two opinions reported from Qatadah. It is also the view of `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam. However, the first view seems to be the most obvious meaning. For this reason, Allah said after it,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُزِّى إِلَيْكِ بِجِذْعِ النَّخْلَةِ</div><p>(And shake the trunk of date palm towards you,) meaning, \"Grab the trunk of the date-palm tree and shake it towards yourself.\" Therefore, Allah blessed her by giving her food and drink. Then He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تُسَـقِطْ عَلَيْكِ رُطَباً جَنِيّاًفَكُلِى وَاشْرَبِى وَقَرِّى عَيْناً</div><p>(It will let fall fresh ripe dates upon you. So eat and drink and rejoice.) Meaning to be happy. This is why `Amr bin Maymun said, \"Nothing is better for the woman confined in childbed than dried dates and fresh dates.\" Then he recited this noble Ayah. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِمَّا تَرَيِنَّ مِنَ البَشَرِ أَحَداً</div><p>(And if you see any human being,) This means any person that you see,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَقُولِى إِنِّى نَذَرْتُ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ صَوْماً فَلَنْ أُكَلِّمَ الْيَوْمَ إِنسِيّاً</div><p>(Say: `Verily, I have vowed a fast unto the Most Gracious (Allah) so I shall not speak to any human being today.') Meaning, by signaling with gestures, not a statement by speech. This is so that she does not negate her oath itself,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَنْ أُكَلِّمَ الْيَوْمَ إِنسِيّاً</div><p>(so I shall not speak to any human being today. ) Anas bin Malik commented on,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنِّى نَذَرْتُ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ صَوْماً</div><p>(I have vowed a fast unto the Most Gracious) He said; \"A vow of silence.\" Likewise said Ibn `Abbas and Ad-Dahhak. The meaning here is that in their Law, when fasting, it was forbidden for them to eat and speak. As-Suddi, Qatadah and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd have all stated this view. `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd said, \"When `Isa said to Maryam,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلاَّ تَحْزَنِى</div><p>(Grieve not) She said, `How can I not grieve when you are with me and I have no husband nor am I an owned slave woman What excuse do I have with the people Woe unto me, if I had only died before this, and had been a thing forgotten and unknown.' Then, `Isa said to her, `I will suffice you with a statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِمَّا تَرَيِنَّ مِنَ البَشَرِ أَحَداً فَقُولِى إِنِّى نَذَرْتُ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ صَوْماً فَلَنْ أُكَلِّمَ الْيَوْمَ إِنسِيّاً</div><p>(And if you see any human being, say: `Verily, I have vowed a fast unto the Most Gracious so I shall not speak to any human being this day.')' All of this is from the speech of `Isa to his mother.\" Wahb said the same as well.</p>"
