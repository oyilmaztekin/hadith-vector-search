    "text": "<h2>The Order to listen to the Qur'an</h2><p>After Allah mentioned that this Qur'an is a clear evidence, guidance and mercy for mankind, He commanded that one listen to the Qur'an when it is recited, in respect and honor of the Qur'an. This is to the contrary of the practice of the pagans of Quraysh, who said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ تَسْمَعُواْ لِهَـذَا الْقُرْءَانِ وَالْغَوْاْ فِيهِ</div><p>(\"Listen not to this Qur'an, and make noise in the midst of its (recitation)\") 41:26. Ibn Jarir reported that Ibn Mas`ud said; \"We would give Salams to each other during Salah. So the Ayah of Qur'an was revealed; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا قُرِىءَ الْقُرْءَانُ فَاسْتَمِعُواْ لَهُ</div><p>(When the Qur'an is recited, then listen to it.) </p>"
