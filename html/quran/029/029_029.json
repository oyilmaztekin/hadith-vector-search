    "text": "<h2>The preaching of Lut and what happened between Him and His People</h2><p>Allah tells us that His Prophet Lut, peace be upon him, denounced his people for their evil deed and their immoral actions in having intercourse with males, a deed which none of the sons of Adam had ever committed before them. As well as doing this, they also disbelieved in Allah and rejected and opposed His Messenger, they robbed wayfarers, they would lie in wait on the road, kill people and loot their possessions.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَأْتُونَ فِى نَادِيكُمُ الْمُنْكَرَ</div><p>(And practice Al-Munkar in your meetings.) This means, `in your gatherings you do and say things that are not befitting, and you do not denounce one another for doing such things.' Some said that they used to have intercourse with one another in public; this was the view of Mujahid. Some said that they used to compete in passing gas and laughing. This was the view of `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, and Al-Qasim. Some of them said that they used to make rams fight one another, or organize cockfights. They used to do all of these things, and they were even eviler than that.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَا كَانَ جَوَابَ قَوْمِهِ إِلاَّ أَن قَالُواْ ائْتِنَا بِعَذَابِ اللَّهِ إِن كُنتَ مِنَ الصَّـدِقِينَ</div><p>(But his people gave no answer except that they said: \"Bring Allah's torment upon us if you are one of the truthful.\") This is indicative of their disbelief, scornful attitude and stubbornness. So Allah's Prophet asked for help against them, and said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبِّ انصُرْنِى عَلَى الْقَوْمِ الْمُفْسِدِينَ</div><p>(My Lord! Give me victory over the people who are corrupt.)</p>"
