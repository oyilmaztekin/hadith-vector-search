    "text": "<h2>The Worst People are Those Who turn away after being reminded</h2><p>Allah says, `Who among My creatures does more wrong than one who is reminded of the signs of Allah then turns away from them,' i.e., ignores them and does not listen or pay attention to them.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنَسِىَ مَا قَدَّمَتْ يَدَاهُ</div><p>(forgetting what his hands have sent forth.) means, bad deeds and evil actions.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّا جَعَلْنَا عَلَى قُلُوبِهِمْ</div><p>(Truly, We have set over their hearts) means, the hearts of these people,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَكِنَّةً</div><p>(Akinnah) means, coverings.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَن يَفْقَهُوهُ</div><p>(lest they should understand this,) means, so that they will not understand this Qur'an and its clear Message</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفِى ءَاذَانِهِمْ وَقْرًا</div><p>(and in their ears, deafness.) means that they will be deaf in an abstract way, to guidance.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن تَدْعُهُمْ إِلَى الْهُدَى فَلَنْ يَهْتَدُواْ إِذاً أَبَداً</div><p>(And if you call them to guidance, even then they will never be guided.)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرَبُّكَ الْغَفُورُ ذُو الرَّحْمَةِ</div><p>(And your Lord is Most Forgiving, Owner of mercy.) means, `your Lord, O Muhammad, is forgiving and has great mercy.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَوْ يُؤَاخِذُهُم بِمَا كَسَبُواْ لَعَجَّلَ لَهُمُ الْعَذَابَ</div><p>(Were He to call them to account for what they have earned, then surely, He would have hastened their punishment.) This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ يُؤَاخِذُ اللَّهُ النَّاسَ بِمَا كَسَبُواْ مَا تَرَكَ عَلَى ظَهْرِهَا مِن دَآبَّةٍ</div><p>(And if Allah were to punish men for that which they earned, He would not leave a moving creature on the surface of the earth.) 35:45</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَذُو مَغْفِرَةٍ لِّلنَّاسِ عَلَى ظُلْمِهِمْ وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَشَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ</div><p>(But verily, your Lord is full of forgiveness for mankind in spite of their wrongdoing. And verily, your Lord is (also) severe in punishment) 13:6. And there are many Ayat which say the same thing. Then Allah tells us that He is patient, He conceals faults and forgives sins. He may guide some of them from wrongdoing to true guidance, and whoever continues in his evil ways, then there will come to him a Day when infants will turn grey and every pregnant female will shed her load. He says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَل لَّهُم مَّوْعِدٌ لَّن يَجِدُواْ مِن دُونِهِ مَوْئِلاً</div><p>(But they have their appointed time, beyond which they will find no escape.) meaning, they will find no way out.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتِلْكَ الْقُرَى أَهْلَكْنَـهُمْ لَمَّا ظَلَمُواْ</div><p>(And these towns, We destroyed them when they did wrong.) This refers to earlier nations in times past; `We destroyed them because of their stubborn disbelief.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلْنَا لِمَهْلِكِهِم مَّوْعِدًا</div><p>(And We appointed a fixed time for their destruction.) `We appointed for them a set time limit, not to be increased or decreased. The same applies to you, O ido- lators, so beware or what happened to them will happen to you too, for you have rejected the noblest Messenger and greatest Prophet, and you are not dearer to Us than them, so fear My punishment and wrath.'</p>"
