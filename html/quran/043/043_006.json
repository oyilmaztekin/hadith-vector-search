    "text": "<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ </div><p> In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حـم - تَنزِيلُ الْكِتَـبِ مِنَ اللَّهِ الْعَزِيزِ الْعَلِيمِ </div><p>(Ha-Mim. By the manifest Book.) means, plain and clear in both wording and meaning, because it was revealed in the language of the Arabs, which is the most eloquent language for communication among people. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّا جَعَلْنَـهُ</div><p>(Verily, We have made it) meaning, revealed it,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُرْءَاناً عَرَبِيّاً</div><p>(a Qur'an in Arabic) meaning, in the language of the Arabs, eloquent and clear;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ</div><p>(that you may be able to understand.) means, that you may understand it and ponder its meanings. This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِلِسَانٍ عَرَبِىٍّ مُّبِينٍ </div><p>(In the plain Arabic language.) (26:195)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ فِى أُمِّ الْكِتَـبِ لَدَيْنَا لَعَلِىٌّ حَكِيمٌ </div><p>(And verily, it is in the Mother of the Book with Us, indeed exalted, full of wisdom.) This explains the high status of the Qur'an among the hosts on high (the angels), so that the people of earth will respect it, venerate it and obey it.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنَّهُ</div><p>(And verily, it) means, the Qur'an,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فِى أُمِّ الْكِتَـبِ</div><p>(is in the Mother of the Book) meaning, Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz (the Preserved Tablet). This was the view of Ibn `Abbas and Mujahid.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَدَيْنَآ</div><p>(with Us,) means, in Our presence. This was the view of Qatadah and others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّعَلِّى</div><p>(indeed exalted) means, occupying a position of honor and virtue. This was the view of Qatadah.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَكِيمٌ</div><p>(full of wisdom.) means, clear, with no confusion or deviation. All of this indicates its noble status and virtue, as Allah says elsewhere:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ لَقُرْءَانٌ كَرِيمٌ - فِى كِتَـبٍ مَّكْنُونٍ - لاَّ يَمَسُّهُ إِلاَّ الْمُطَهَّرُونَ - تَنزِيلٌ مِّن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ </div><p>(That (this) is indeed an honorable recitation. In a Book well-guarded. Which none can touch but the pure. A revelation from the Lord of the all that exists.) (56:77-80)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَلاَّ إِنَّهَا تَذْكِرَةٌ فَمَن شَآءَ ذَكَرَهُ فَى صُحُفٍ مُّكَرَّمَةٍ مَّرْفُوعَةٍ مُّطَهَّرَةٍ بِأَيْدِى سَفَرَةٍ كِرَامٍ بَرَرَةٍ </div><p>(Nay, indeed it is an admonition. So whoever wills, let him pay attention to it. (It is) in Records held (greatly) in honor, exalted, purified, in the hands of scribes (angels), honorable and obedient.) (80:11-16)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَنَضْرِبُ عَنكُمُ الذِّكْرَ صَفْحاً أَن كُنتُمْ قَوْماً مُّسْرِفِينَ </div><p>(Shall We then take away the Reminder (this Qur'an) from you, because you are a people excessive.) means, `do you think that We will forgive you and not punish you, when you do not do as you have been commanded' This was the view of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Abu Salih, Mujahid and As-Suddi, and was the view favored by Ibn Jarir.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَنَضْرِبُ عَنكُمُ الذِّكْرَ صَفْحاً</div><p>(Shall We then take away the Reminder (this Qur'an) from you,) Qatadah said, \"By Allah, if this Qur'an had been taken away when the first generations of this Ummah rejected it, they would have been doomed, but Allah by His mercy persisted in sending it and calling them to it for twenty years, or for as long as He willed.\" What Qatadah said is very good, and his point is that Allah, by His grace and mercy towards His creation, did not stop calling them to the truth and to the wise Reminder, i.e., the Qur'an, even though they were heedless and turned away from it. Indeed, He sent it so that those who were decreed to be guided might be guided by it, and so that proof might be established against those who were decreed to be.</p><p>(In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.)</p><h2>Consolation to the Prophet for the Disbelief of Quraysh</h2><p>Then Allah consoles His Prophet for the disbelief of his people, and commands him to bear it with patience.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَمْ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن نَّبِيٍّ فِى الاٌّوَّلِينَ </div><p>(And how many a Prophet have We sent amongst the men of old.) meaning, among the sects (communities) of old.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا يَأْتِيهِم مِّنْ نَّبِىٍّ إِلاَّ كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ </div><p>(And never came there a Prophet to them but they used to mock at him.) means, they disbelieved him and mock at him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَهْلَكْنَآ أَشَدَّ مِنْهُم بَطْشاً</div><p>(Then We destroyed men stronger than these) means, `We destroyed those who disbelieved in the Messengers, and they were stronger in power than these who disbelieve in you, O Muhammad.' This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ فَيَنظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ كَانُواْ أَكْـثَرَ مِنْهُمْ وَأَشَدَّ قُوَّةً</div><p>(Have they not traveled through the earth and seen what was the end of those before them They were more in number than them and mightier in strength) (40:82). And there are many similar Ayat.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَضَى مَثَلُ الاٌّوَّلِينَ</div><p>(and the example of the ancients has passed away. ) Mujahid said, \"The way of their life.\" Qatadah said, \"Their punishment.\" Others said, \"Their lesson,\" i.e., `We made them a lesson for those disbelievers who came after them, that they would suffer the same end as them,' as in the Ayah at the end of this Surah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَجَعَلْنَـهُمْ سَلَفاً وَمَثَلاً لِّلاٌّخِرِينَ </div><p>(And We made them a precedent, and an example to later generations.) (43:56);</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سُنَّةَ اللَّهِ الَّتِى قَدْ خَلَتْ فِى عِبَادِهِ</div><p>(this has been the way of Allah in dealing with His servants) (40:85).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَن تَجِدَ لِسُنَّةِ اللَّهِ تَبْدِيلاً</div><p>(and you will not find any change in the way of Allah.) (33:62)</p>"
