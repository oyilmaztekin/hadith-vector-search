    "text": "<h2>Hypocrites among the Bedouins and Residents of Al-Madinah</h2><p>Allah informs His Messenger, peace be upon him, that among the bedouins around Al-Madinah there are hypocrites and in Al-Madinah itself, those,</p><p>مَرَدُواْ عَلَى النَّفَاقِ</p><p>(who persist in hypocrisy;) meaning they insisted on hypocrisy and continued in it Allah's statement,</p><p>لاَ تَعْلَمُهُمْ نَحْنُ نَعْلَمُهُمْ</p><p>(you know them not, We know them), does not contradict His other statement,</p><p>وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لأَرَيْنَـكَهُمْ فَلَعَرَفْتَهُم بِسِيمَـهُمْ وَلَتَعْرِفَنَّهُمْ فِى لَحْنِ الْقَوْلِ</p><p>(Had We willed, We could have shown them to you, and you should have known them by their marks; but surely, you will know them by the tone of their speech!)47:30, because the latter Ayah describes them by their characteristics, not that the Messenger ﷺ knows all those who have doubts and hypocrisy. The Messenger ﷺ knew that some of those who associated with him from the people of Al-Madinah were hypocrites, and he used to see them day and night but did not know who they were exactly. We mentioned before in the explanation of,</p><p>وَهَمُّواْ بِمَا لَمْ يَنَالُواْ</p><p>(...and they resolved that (plot) which they were unable to carry out...)9:74 that the Prophet informed Hudhayfah of the names of fourteen or fifteen hypocrites. This knowledge is specific in this case, not that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was informed of all their names, and Allah knows best. `Abdur-Razzaq narrated that Ma`mar said that Qatadah commented on this Ayah 9:101, \"What is the matter with some people who claim to have knowledge about other people, saying, `So-and-so is in Paradise and so-and-so is in the Fire.' If you ask any of these people about himself, he would say, `I do not know (if I will end up in Paradise or the Fire)!' Verily, you have more knowledge of yourself than other people. You have assumed a job that even the Prophets before you refrained from assuming. Allah's Prophet Nuh said,</p><p>وَمَا عِلْمِى بِمَا كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(And what knowledge have I of what they used to do)26:112 Allah's Prophet Shu`ayb said,</p><p>بَقِيَّتُ اللَّهِ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ إِن كُنتُم مُّؤْمِنِينَ وَمَآ أَنَاْ عَلَيْكُمْ بِحَفِيظٍ</p><p>(That which is left by Allah for you (after giving the rights of the people) is better for you, if you are believers. And I am not a guardian over you)11:86, while Allah said to His Prophet ,</p><p>لاَ تَعْلَمُهُمْ نَحْنُ نَعْلَمُهُمْ</p><p>(you know them not, We know them.)\" Mujahid said about Allah's statement,</p><p>سَنُعَذِّبُهُم مَّرَّتَيْنِ</p><p>(We shall punish them twice), \"By killing and capture.\" In another narration he said, \"By hunger and torment in the grave,</p><p>ثُمَّ يُرَدُّونَ إِلَى عَذَابٍ عَظِيمٍ</p><p>(and thereafter they shall be brought back to a great (horrible) torment.)\" `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said, \"The torment in this life strikes their wealth and offspring,\" and he recited this Ayah,</p><p>فَلاَ تُعْجِبْكَ أَمْوَلُهُمْ وَلاَ أَوْلَـدُهُمْ إِنَّمَا يُرِيدُ اللَّهُ لِيُعَذِّبَهُمْ بِهَا فِي الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا</p><p>(So let not their wealth nor their children amaze you; Allah only wants to punish them with these things in the life of this world.) 9:55 These afflictions torment them, but will bring reward for the believers. As for the torment in the Hereafter, it is in the Fire,</p><p>ثُمَّ يُرَدُّونَ إِلَى عَذَابٍ عَظِيمٍ</p><p>(and thereafter they shall be brought back to a great (horrible) torment.)</p>"
