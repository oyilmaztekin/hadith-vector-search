    "text": "<h2>Denouncing the Worship of anything besides Allah</h2><p>Allah tells us about the Mushrikin who worship others besides Him, even though He alone is the bountiful Provider, the Creator and Sustainer, without partners or associates, but they still worship idols and make rivals for Him. He says: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا لاَ يَمْلِكُ لَهُمْ رِزْقًا مِّنَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ شَيْئًا</div><p>(such as do not have power to grant them any provision from the heavens or the earth) meaning, nobody can cause rain to fall, or make plants and trees grow. They cannot do these things for them- selves, even if they wanted to. Thus Allah says: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ تَضْرِبُواْ لِلَّهِ الاٌّمْثَالَ</div><p>(So do not give examples on behalf of Allah.) meaning, do not set up rivals to Him or describe anything as being like Him. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ وَأَنتُمْ لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(Truly, Allah knows and you know not.) meaning, He knows and bears witness that there is no god but Him, but you are ignorant and associate others in worship with Him. </p>"
