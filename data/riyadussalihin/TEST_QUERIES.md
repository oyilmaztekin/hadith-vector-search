# Hadith Search System - Test Query Collection

**Dataset:** Riyad as-Salihin (~1,900 hadiths across 21 books)
**Purpose:** Comprehensive test queries for benchmarking hybrid search system
**Generated:** Based on Gemini analysis of actual JSONL data

---

## Data Quality Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Encoding Issue Detected:**
- `book_8.jsonl` and `book_17.jsonl` have corrupted Arabic text (mojibake)
- Example: `–©“ì–®”ò–®¬ß–®–Å –®¬ß–©‚Äû–©“í–®¬∂–®¬ß–®“∞–©‚Äû` instead of proper Arabic
- **Action Required:** Re-scrape or fix encoding before indexing

- Extract key terms (patience, hypocrite, intention, etc.)
- Apply semantic matching for "how to" intent
- Results should be instructional/descriptive hadiths

## Notes for Implementation

1. **Priority Areas:**
   - Exact reference queries MUST be fast (<5ms)
   - Narrator matching MUST be accurate (100%)
   - Arabic queries require multilingual embeddings

2. **Data Quality Fix Required:**
   - Re-scrape or fix encoding for book_8.jsonl and book_17.jsonl
   - Validate Arabic text before indexing

3. **Benchmark Goals:**
   - Match or exceed Appcircle's 100% win rate
   - Achieve >70% average term coverage
   - Maintain <50ms p95 latency for vector search

4. **Query Router Accuracy:**
   - Should correctly classify >95% of queries
   - Misclassification acceptable only for ambiguous edge cases
