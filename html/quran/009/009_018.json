    "text": "<h2>It is not for Idolators to maintain the Masjids of Allah</h2><p>Allah says that it is not fitting that those who associate others with Allah in worship should maintain the Masjids of Allah that were built in His Name alone without partners. Those who read the Ayah, \"Masjid Allah\", said that it refers to Al-Masjid Al-Haram, the most honored Masjid on the earth, which was built, from the first day, for the purpose of worshipping Allah alone without partners. It was built by Khalil Ar-Rahman (the Prophet Ibrahim) peace be upon him. The idolators do this while they themselves testify to their disbelief with their statements and actions. As-Suddi said, \"If you ask a Christian, `What is your religion', He will tell you he is a Christian. If you ask a Jew about his religion, he will say he is a Jew, and the same for a Sabi' and a Mushrik!\"' </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُوْلَـئِكَ حَبِطَتْ أَعْمَـلُهُمْ</div><p>(The works of such are in vain), because of their Shirk, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفِى النَّارِ هُمْ خَـلِدُونَ</div><p>(and in Fire shall they abide.) Allah said in another Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا لَهُمْ أَلاَّ يُعَذِّبَهُمُ اللَّهُ وَهُمْ يَصُدُّونَ عَنِ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ وَمَا كَانُواْ أَوْلِيَآءَهُ إِنْ أَوْلِيَآؤُهُ إِلاَّ الْمُتَّقُونَ وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ </div><p>(And why should not Allah punish them while they hinder (men) from Al-Masjid Al-Haram, and they are not its guardians None can be its guardians except those with Taqwa, but most of them know not.)8:34.</p><h2>Believers are the True Maintainers of the Masjids</h2><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّمَا يَعْمُرُ مَسَـجِدَ اللَّهِ مَنْ ءَامَنَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ</div><p>(The Masjids of Allah shall be maintained only by those who believe in Allah and the Last Day.) Therefore, Allah testifies to the faith of those who maintain the Masjids. `Abdur-Razzaq narrated that `Amr bin Maymun Al-Awdi said, \"I met the Companions of the Prophet and they were saying, `The Masjids are the Houses of Allah on the earth. It is a promise from Allah that He is generous to those who visit Him in the Masjids.,\" Allah said next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَقَامَ الصَّلَوةَ</div><p>(perform the Salah), one of the major acts of worship practiced by the body, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَءَاتَى الزَّكَوةَ</div><p>(and give the Zakah), which is the best act that benefits other people, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمْ يَخْشَ إِلاَّ اللَّهَ</div><p>(and fear none but Allah), they fear only Allah, the Exalted, and none else, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَعَسَى أُوْلَـئِكَ أَن يَكُونُواْ مِنَ الْمُهْتَدِينَ</div><p>(It is they who are on true guidance.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn `Abbas said about Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّمَا يَعْمُرُ مَسَـجِدَ اللَّهِ مَنْ ءَامَنَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ</div><p>(The Masjids of Allah shall be maintained only by those who believe in Allah and the Last Day;) \"He who singles out Allah (in worship), has faith in the Last Day.\" And he said; \"He who believes in what Allah has revealed, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَقَامَ الصَّلَوةَ</div><p>(perform the Salah), establishes the five daily prayers, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمْ يَخْشَ إِلاَّ اللَّهَ</div><p>(and fear none but Allah.), worships Allah alone, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَعَسَى أُوْلَـئِكَ أَن يَكُونُواْ مِنَ الْمُهْتَدِينَ</div><p>(it may be they who are on true guidance.) Allah says, `It is they who are the successful ones in truth.' Similarly, Allah said to His Prophet , </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَسَى أَن يَبْعَثَكَ رَبُّكَ مَقَاماً مَّحْمُودًا</div><p>(It may be that your Lord will raise you to Maqam Mahmud)17:79. Allah says here, `Your Lord (O Muhammad) shall grant you a station of praise, that is, the intercession (on the Day of Resurrection).' Every `might' in the Qur'an means `shall'.\" </p>"
