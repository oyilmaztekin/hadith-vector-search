    "text": "<h2>Rewards of Righteous Believers</h2><p>After mentioning the torment that Allah has prepared for His miserable enemies who disbelieve in Him and in His Messengers, He mentions the condition of His happy, loyal friends who believe in Him and in His Messengers, adhere to the faith and perform the good deeds. This is the reason why the Qur'an was called Mathani, based on the correct opinion of the scholars. We will elaborate upon this subject later. Mathani means to mention faith and then disbelief, or vice versa. Or, Allah mentions the miserable and then the happy, or vice versa. As for mentioning similar things, it is called Tashabbuh, as we will come to know, Allah willing. Allah said,</p><p>وَبَشِّرِ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَاتِ أَنَّ لَهُمْ جَنَّـتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الأَنْهَـرُ</p><p>(And give glad tidings to those who believe and do righteous good deeds, that for them will be Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise)). Consequently, Allah stated that Paradise has rivers that run beneath it, meaning, underneath its trees and rooms. From Hadiths it is learned that the rivers of Paradise do not run in valleys, and that the banks of Al-Kawthar (the Prophet's lake in Paradise) are made of domes of hollow pearls, the sand of Paradise is made of scented musk while its stones are made from pearls and jewels. We ask Allah to grant Paradise to us, for verily, He is the Most Beneficent, Most Gracious.</p><p>Ibn Abi Hatim reported that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«أَنْهَارُ الْجَنَّةِ تَفَجَّرُ تَحْتَ تِلَالٍ أَوْ مِنْ تَحْتِ جِبَالِ الْمِسْك»</p><p>(The rivers of Paradise spring from beneath hills, or mountains of musk.)</p><p>He also reported from Masruq that `Abdullah said, \"The rivers of Paradise spring from beneath mountains of musk.\"</p><h2>The similarity between the Fruits of Paradise</h2><p>Allah said next,</p><p>كُلَّمَا رُزِقُواْ مِنْهَا مِن ثَمَرَةٍ رِّزْقاً قَالُواْ هَـذَا الَّذِى رُزِقْنَا مِن قَبْلُ</p><p>(Every time they will be provided with a fruit therefrom, they will say: \"This is what we were provided with before\").</p><p>Ibn Abi Hatim reported that Yahya bin Abi Kathir said, \"The grass of Paradise is made of saffron, its hills from musk and the boys of everlasting youth will serve the believers with fruits which they will eat. They will then be brought similar fruits, and the people of Paradise will comment, `This is the same as what you have just brought us.' The boys will say to them, `Eat, for the color is the same, but the taste is different. Hence Allah's statement,</p><p>وَأُتُواْ بِهِ مُتَشَـبِهاً</p><p>(and they will be given things in resemblance). Abu Ja`far Ar-Razi narrated that Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said that Abu Al-`Aliyah said that,</p><p>وَأُتُواْ بِهِ مُتَشَـبِهاً</p><p>(and they will be given things in resemblance) means, \"They look like each other, but the taste is different.\" Also, `Ikrimah said,</p><p>وَأُتُواْ بِهِ مُتَشَـبِهاً</p><p>(and they will be given things in resemblance) \"They are similar to the fruits of this life, but the fruits of Paradise taste better. \" Sufyan Ath-Thawri reported from Al-A`mash, from Abu Thubyan, that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Nothing in Paradise resembles anything in the life of this world, except in name.\" In another narration, Ibn `Abbas said, \"Only the names are similar between what is in this life and what is in Paradise.\"</p><h2>The Wives of the People of Paradise are Pure</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَلَهُمْ فِيهَآ أَزْوَجٌ مُّطَهَّرَةٌ</p><p>(and they shall have therein Azwajun Mutahharatun). Ibn Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Purified from filth and impurity.\" Also, Mujahid said, \"From menstruation, relieving the call of nature, urine, spit, semen and pregnancies.\" Also, Qatadah said, \"Purified from impurity and sin.\" In another narration, he said, \"From menstruation and pregnancies.\" Further, `Ata', Al-Hasan, Ad-Dahhak, Abu Salih, `Atiyah and As-Suddi were reported to have said similarly.</p><p>Allah's statement,</p><p>وَهُمْ فِيهَا خَـلِدُونَ</p><p>(and they will abide therein forever) meaning ultimate happiness, for the believers will enjoy everlasting delight, safe from death and disruption of their bliss, for it never ends or ceases. We ask Allah to make us among these believers, for He is the Most Generous, Most Kind and Most merciful.</p>"
