And worst indeed is that destination!) 58:8. Allah said in this Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلِ اسْتَهْزِءُواْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ مُخْرِجٌ مَّا تَحْذَرُونَ</div><p>(Say: \"(Go ahead and) mock! But certainly Allah will bring to light all that you fear.\"), He will expose and explain your reality to His Messenger through revelation. Allah said in other Ayat, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ حَسِبَ الَّذِينَ فِى قُلُوبِهِمْ مَّرَضٌ أَن لَّن يُخْرِجَ اللَّهُ أَضْغَـنَهُمْ </div><p>(Or do those in whose hearts is a disease (of hypocrisy), think that Allah will not bring to light all their hidden ill-wills) 47:29, until, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَتَعْرِفَنَّهُمْ فِى لَحْنِ الْقَوْلِ</div><p>(but surely, you will know them by the tone of their speech!)47:30. This is why, according to Qatadah, this Surah is called `Al-Fadihah' (the Exposing), because it exposed the hypocrites. </p>"
