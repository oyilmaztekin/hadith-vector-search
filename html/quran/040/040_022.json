This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ مَكَّنَـهُمْ فِيمَآ إِن مَّكَّنَّـكُمْ فِيهِ</div><p>(And indeed We had firmly established them with that wherewith We have not established you!) (46:26)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَثَارُواْ الاٌّرْضَ وَعَمَرُوهَآ أَكْثَرَ مِمَّا عَمَرُوهَا</div><p>(and they tilled the earth and populated it in greater numbers than these have done) (30:9). Yet despite this great strength, Allah punished them for their sin, which was their disbelief in their Messengers.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كَانَ لَهُم مِّنَ اللَّهِ مِن وَاقٍ</div><p>(And none had they to protect them from Allah.) means, they had no one who could protect them or ward off the punishment from them. Then Allah mentions the reason why He punished them, and the sins which they committed. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ كَانَت تَّأْتِيهِمْ رُسُلُهُم بِالْبَيِّنَـتِ</div><p>(That was because there came to them their Messengers with clear evidences) meaning with clear proof and definitive evidence.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَفَرُواْ</div><p>(but they disbelieved.) means, despite all these signs, they disbelieved and rejected the Message.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَخَذَهُمُ اللَّهُ</div><p>(So Allah seized them.) means, He destroyed them utterly, and a similar fate awaits the disbelievers.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ قَوِىٌّ شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ</div><p>(Verily, He is All-Strong, Severe in punishment) means, He is possessed of great strength and might.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">شَدِيدُ الْعِقَابِ</div><p>(Severe in punishment, ) means, His punishment is severe and agonizing; we seek refuge with Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, from that.</p>"
