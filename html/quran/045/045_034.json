    "text": "<h2>Allah states to us His judgement in His creation on the Day of Resurrection,</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ</div><p>(Then, as for those who believed and did good deeds,) Those whose hearts believed and their limbs performed good deeds, in sincerity to Allah and conforming with Islamic legislation;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَيُدْخِلُهُمْ رَبُّهُمْ فِى رَحْمَتِهِ</div><p>(their Lord will admit them to His mercy. ) and that is Paradise. In the Sahih, Allah said to Paradise;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَنْتِ رَحْمَتِي، أَرْحَمُ بِكِ مَنْ أَشَاء»</div><p>(\"You are My mercy, with which I grant mercy to whom I will,\") Allah said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذَلِكَ هُوَ الْفَوْزُ الْمُبِينُ</div><p>(That will be the evident success.) clear and apparent. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ أَفَلَمْ تَكُنْ ءَايَـتِى تُتْلَى عَلَيْكُمْ فَاسْتَكْبَرْتُمْ</div><p>(But as for those who disbelieved (it will be said to them): \"Were not Our Ayat recited to you But you were proud...\") They will be admonished and criticized with this statement, that means, `have not the Ayat of Ar-Rahman been recited to you But you did not follow them out of pride and turned away upon hearing them,'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكُنتُمْ قَوْماً مُّجْرِمِينَ</div><p>(and you were a people who were criminals.), `by your actions, as well as, the denial that your hearts contained.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا قِيلَ إِنَّ وعْدَ اللَّهِ حَقٌّ وَالسَّاعَةُ لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهَا</div><p>(And when it was said: \"Verily, Allah's promise is the truth, and there is no doubt about the coming of the Hour,\") `when the believers said these words to you;'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْتُم مَّا نَدْرِى مَا السَّاعَةُ</div><p>(you said: \"We know not what is the Hour...\") `we do not recognize what you are talking about,'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِن نَّظُنُّ إِلاَّ ظَنّاً</div><p>(we do not think it but conjecture,) `we only remotely think that it might come,'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا نَحْنُ بِمُسْتَيْقِنِينَ</div><p>(and we have no firm convincing belief (therein).) `we are not sure of it.' Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَبَدَا لَهُمْ سَيِّئَـتُ مَا عَمِلُواْ</div><p>(And the evil of what they did will appear to them,) the repercussion of their evil deeds will become apparent to them,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَحَاقَ بِهِم</div><p>(and will completely encircle them.) from all directions,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ</div><p>(that which they used to mock at) of the coming torment and punishment,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقِيلَ الْيَوْمَ نَنسَاكُمْ</div><p>(And it will be said: \"This Day We will forget you...\") `We will treat you as if We have forgotten you, casting you in the fire of Jahannam,'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَمَا نَسِيتُمْ لِقَآءَ يَوْمِكُمْ هَـذَا</div><p>(as you forgot the meeting of this Day of yours.) `and did not work for it because you did not believe in its coming,'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَأْوَاكُمُ النَّارُ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن نَّـصِرِينَ</div><p>(And your abode is the Fire, and there is none to help you.) In the Sahih, it is reported that Allah the Exalted will ask some of His servants on the Day of Resurrection,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَلَمْ أُزَوِّجْكَ؟ أَلَمْ أُكْرِمْكَ؟ أَلَمْ أُسَخِّرْ لَكَ الْخَيْلَ وَالْإِبِلَ، وَأَذَرْكَ تَرْأَسُ وَتَرْبَعُ؟ فَيَقُولُ: بَلَى يَارَبِّ. فَيَقُولُ: أَفَظَنَنْتَ أَنَّكَ مُلَاقِيَّ؟ فَيَقُولُ: لَا. فَيَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالَى: فَالْيَوْمَ أَنْسَاكَ كَمَا نَسِيتَنِي»</div><p>(\"Have I not given you a spouse, honored you and subjected the camels and horses to you Have I not allowed you to be a chief and a master\" The servant will say in answer, \"Yes, O Lord!\" Allah will say, \"Did you think that you would ever meet Me\" He will say, \"No.\" Allah the Exalted will say, \"then this Day, I will forget you as you forgot Me.\") Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذَلِكُم بِأَنَّكُمُ اتَّخَذْتُمْ ءَايَـتِ اللَّهِ هُزُواً</div><p>(This, because you took the revelations of Allah in mockery.) `We gave you this punishment as retribution because you mocked Allah's proofs that He sent to you, and made them the subject of jokes and jest,'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَغَرَّتْكُمُ الْحَيَوةُ الدُّنْيَا</div><p>(and the life of the world deceived you.) `this life fooled you and you were seduced by to it, thus becoming among the ultimate losers,'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَالْيَوْمَ لاَ يُخْرَجُونَ مِنْهَا</div><p>(So this Day, they shall not be taken out from there), from Hellfire,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ هُمْ يُسْتَعْتَبُونَ</div><p>(nor shall they be returned to the worldly life.) no apologies shall be sought from them, but they will be punished without limit or delay, just as a group of the believers will enter Paradise without limit or delay. After Allah mentioned His judgement for the believers and the disbelievers, He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلِلَّهِ الْحَمْدُ رَبِّ السَّمَـوَتِ وَرَبِّ الاٌّرْضِ</div><p>(So all praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the heavens and the Lord of the earth,) He is their Owner and the Owner of all that is in and on them, and surely,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ</div><p>(and the Lord of all that exists.) Allah said next,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَهُ الْكِبْرِيَآءُ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ</div><p>(And His is the majesty in the heavens and the earth, ) meaning, the kingship, according to Mujahid. This Ayah means, Allah is the Almighty, Worthy of all praise; everything and everyone is subservient and in complete need of and dependent upon Him. In an authentic Hadith, the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالَى: الْعَظَمَةُ إِزَارِي، وَالْكِبْرِيَاءُ رِدَائِي، فَمَنْ نَازَعَنِي وَاحِدًا مِنْهُمَا أَسْكَنْتُهُ نَارِي»</div><p>(Allah the Exalted said, \"Glory is My robe and pride is My garment; whoever rivals Me for either of them, I will make him reside in My Fire!\") Muslim collected a similar Hadith. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ</div><p>(and He is the Al-`Aziz,) Who is never resisted or rivaled,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الْحَكِيمُ</div><p>(Al-Hakim) all wise in His statements, actions, legislation and the decree that He appoints; all glory and praise are due to Him, none has the right to be worshipped but He, Alone. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Jathiyah. All praise and thanks are due to Allah alone.</p>"
