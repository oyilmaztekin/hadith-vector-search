    "text": "<h2>The Story of Hud, Peace be upon Him, and the Lineage of the People of `Ad</h2><p>Allah says, just as We sent Nuh to his people, similarly, to the `Ad people, We sent Hud one of their own brethren. Muhammad bin Ishaq said that the tribe of `Ad were the descendants of `Ad, son of Iram, son of `Aws, son of Sam, son of Nuh. I say, these are indeed the ancient people of `Ad whom Allah mentioned, the children of `Ad, son of Iram who were living in the deserts with lofty pillars or statues. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَمْ تَرَ كَيْفَ فَعَلَ رَبُّكَ بِعَادٍ - إِرَمَ ذَاتِ الْعِمَادِ - الَّتِى لَمْ يُخْلَقْ مِثْلُهَا فِى الْبِلَـدِ </div><p>(Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with `Ad (people). Of Iram like (lofty) pillars. The like of which were not created in the land) 89:6-8 because of their might and strength. Allah said in another instance, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَمَّا عَادٌ فَاسْتَكْبَرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ بِغَيْرِ الْحَقِّ وَقَالُواْ مَنْ أَشَدُّ مِنَّا قُوَّةً أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ الَّذِى خَلَقَهُمْ هُوَ أَشَدُّ مِنْهُمْ قُوَّةً وَكَانُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا يَجْحَدُونَ </div><p>(As for `Ad, they were arrogant in the land without right, and they said: \"Who is mightier than us in strength\" See they not that Allah Who created them was mightier in strength than them. And they used to deny Our Ayat!) 41:15. </p><h2>The Land of `Ad</h2><p>The people of `Ad lived in Yemen, in the area of Ahqaf, which means sand mounds. Muhammad bin Ishaq narrated that Abu At-Tufayl `Amir bin Wathilah said that he heard `Ali (bin Abi Talib) saying to a man from Hadramawt (in Yemen), \"Have you seen a red sand mound, where there are a lot of Arak and Lote trees in the area of so-and-so in Hadramawt Have you seen it\" He said, \"Yes, O Commander of the faithful! By Allah, you described it as if you have seen it before.\" `Ali said, `I have not seen it, but it was described to me.\" The man asked, \"What about it, O Commander of the faithful\" `Ali said, \"There is the grave of Hud, peace be upon him, in its vicinity.\" Ibn Jarir recorded this statement, which gives the benefit of indicating that `Ad used to live in Yemen, since Prophet Hud was buried there. Prophet Hud was among the noble men and chiefs of `Ad, for Allah chose the Messengers from among the best, most honorable families and tribes. Hud's people were mighty and strong, but their hearts were mighty and hard, for they were among the most denying of Truth among the nations. Prophet Hud called `Ad to worship Allah alone without partners, and to obey and fear Him. </p><h2>Debate between Hud and his People</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ الْمَلأُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِن قَوْمِهِ</div><p>(The leaders of those who disbelieved among his people said...) meaning, the general public, chiefs, masters and commanders of his people said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّا لَنَرَاكَ فِي سَفَاهَةٍ وِإِنَّا لَنَظُنُّكَ مِنَ الْكَـذِبِينَ</div><p>(\"Verily, we see you in foolishness, and verily, we think you are one of the liars\") meaning, you are misguided because you call us to abandon worshipping the idols in order to worship Allah Alone. Similarly, the chiefs of Quraysh wondered at the call to worship One God, saying, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَجَعَلَ الاٌّلِهَةَ إِلَـهاً وَحِداً</div><p>(\"Has he (Muhammad) made the gods (all) into One God\") 38:5. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ يَـقَوْمِ لَيْسَ بِى سَفَاهَةٌ وَلَكِنِّى رَسُولٌ مِّن رَّبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ </div><p>((Hud) said: \"O my people! There is no foolishness in me, but (I am) a Messenger from the Lord of all that exists!\") Hud said, I am not as you claim. Rather, I brought you the Truth from Allah, Who created everything, and He is the Lord and King of all things, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُبَلِّغُكُمْ رِسَـلـتِ رَبِّى وَأَنَاْ لَكُمْ نَاصِحٌ أَمِينٌ </div><p>(\"I convey unto you the Messages of my Lord, and I am a trustworthy adviser for you. \") These, indeed, are the qualities of the Prophets: conveying, sincerity and honesty, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَ عَجِبْتُمْ أَن جَآءَكُمْ ذِكْرٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ عَلَى رَجُلٍ مِّنْكُمْ لِيُنذِرَكُمْ</div><p>(\"Do you wonder that there has come to you a Reminder from your Lord through a man from among you to warn you\") Prophet Hud said, do not wonder because Allah sent a Messenger to you from among yourselves to warn you about Allah's Days (His torment) and meeting with Him. Rather than wondering, you should thank Allah for this bounty. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاذكُرُواْ إِذْ جَعَلَكُمْ خُلَفَآءَ مِن بَعْدِ قَوْمِ نُوحٍ</div><p>(\"And remember that He made you successors (generations after generations) after the people of Nuh...\") meaning, remember Allah's favor on you in that He made you among the offspring of Nuh, because of whose supplication Allah destroyed the people of the earth after they defied and opposed him. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَزَادَكُمْ فِى الْخَلْقِ بَسْطَةً</div><p>(\"and increased you amply in stature.\") making you taller than other people. Similarly, Allah said in the description of Talut (Saul), </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَزَادَهُ بَسْطَةً فِي الْعِلْمِ وَالْجِسْمِ</div><p>(And has increased him abundantly in knowledge and stature.) 2:247 Hud continued, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاذْكُرُواْ ءَالآءَ اللَّهِ</div><p>(\"So remember the graces (bestowed upon you) from Allah. \") in reference to Allah's favors and blessings </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ</div><p>(\"so that you may be successful.\") </p>"
