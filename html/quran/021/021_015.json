    "text": "<h2>The Virtue of the Qur'an Here</h2><p>Allah points out the noble status of the Qur'an and urges them to recognize its worth:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ أَنزَلْنَآ إِلَيْكُمْ كِتَـباً فِيهِ ذِكْرُكُمْ</div><p>(Indeed, We have sent down for you a Book in which there is Dhikrukum). Ibn `Abbas said: \"Honor for you.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَلاَ تَعْقِلُونَ</div><p>(Will you not then understand) means, will you not understand this blessing, and accept it This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ وَلِقَوْمِكَ وَسَوْفَ تُسْـَلُونَ </div><p>(And verily, this is indeed a Reminder for you and your people, and you will be questioned.) 43:44</p><h2>How the Evildoers were destroyed</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَمْ قَصَمْنَا مِن قَرْيَةٍ كَانَتْ ظَـلِمَةً</div><p>(How many a town given to wrongdoing, have We destroyed,) meaning, they were very many. This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَمْ أَهْلَكْنَا مِنَ الْقُرُونِ مِن بَعْدِ نُوحٍ</div><p>(And how many generations have We destroyed after Nuh!) 17:17</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَأَيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ أَهْلَكْنَـهَا وَهِىَ ظَالِمَةٌ فَهِىَ خَاوِيَةٌ عَلَى عُرُوشِهَا</div><p>(And many a township did We destroy while they were given to wrongdoing, so that it lie in ruins) 22:45.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنشَأْنَا بَعْدَهَا قَوْماً ءَاخَرِينَ</div><p>(and raised up after them another people!) means, another nation which came after them.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّآ أَحَسُّواْ بَأْسَنَآ</div><p>(Then, when they sensed Our torment,) when they realized that the torment would undoubtedly come upon them, just as their Prophet had warned them,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذَا هُمْ مِّنْهَا يَرْكُضُونَ</div><p>(behold, they (tried to) flee from it.) they tried to run away.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ تَرْكُضُواْ وَارْجِعُواْ إِلَى مَآ أُتْرِفْتُمْ فِيهِ وَمَسَـكِنِكُمْ</div><p>(Flee not, but return to that wherein you lived a luxurious life, and to your homes,) This is a way of ridiculing them. It will be said to them by way of ridicule: \"Do not run away from the coming torment; go back to the delights and luxuries and fine homes in which you were living.\" Qatadah said, \"Mocking them.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَعَلَّكُمْ تُسْأَلُونَ</div><p>(in order that you may be questioned) about whether you gave thanks for what you had.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالُواْ يوَيْلَنَآ إِنَّا كُنَّا ظَـلِمِينَ </div><p>(They cried: \"Woe to us! Certainly we have been wrong- doers.\") They will confess their sins when it will be of no benefit to them.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَا زَالَت تِلْكَ دَعْوَاهُمْ حَتَّى جَعَلْنَـهُمْ حَصِيداً خَـمِدِينَ </div><p>(And that cry of theirs ceased not, till We made them as a field that is reaped, extinct.) meaning, \"they will keep on saying that, admitting their wrong- doing, until We harvest them as it were, and their movements and voices come to a stop.\"</p>"
