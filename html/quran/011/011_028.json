That is the greatest mercy from Allah upon him (Nuh) and them (his people). </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَعُمِّيَتْ عَلَيْكُمْ</div><p>(but that (mercy) has been obscured from your sight.) \"Obscured from your sight\" in this verse means, `it was hidden from you and you are not guided to it. Thus, you people did not know its importance so you hastily rejected and denied it.' </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَنُلْزِمُكُمُوهَا</div><p>(Shall we compel you (to accept) it) This means, \"Should we force you to accept it, while you actually detest it.\" </p>"
