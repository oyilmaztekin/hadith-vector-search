    "text": "<h2>Yusuf asks the King's Distiller to mention Him to the King</h2><p>Yusuf knew that the distiller would be saved. So discretely, so that the other man's suspicion that he would be crucified would not intensify, he said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اذْكُرْنِى عِندَ رَبِّكَ</div><p>(Mention me to your King.) asking him to mention his story to the king. That man forgot Yusuf's request and did not mention his story to the king, a plot from the devil, so that Allah's Prophet would not leave the prison. This is the correct meaning of, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَنْسَاهُ الشَّيْطَـنُ ذِكْرَ رَبِّهِ</div><p>(But Shaytan made him forget to mention it to his master.) that it refers to the man who was saved. As was said by Mujahid, Muhammad bin Ishaq and several others. As for, `a few years', or, Bida` in Arabic, it means between three and nine, according to Mujahid and Qatadah. Wahb bin Munabbih said, \"Ayyub suffered from the illness for seven years, Yusuf remained in prison for seven years and Bukhtanassar (Nebuchadnezzar - Chaldean king of Babylon) was tormented for seven years.\" </p>"
