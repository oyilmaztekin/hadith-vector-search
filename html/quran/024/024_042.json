    "text": "<h2>Everything glorifies Allah, may He be exalted, and to Him belongs the Sovereignty</h2><p>Allah tells us that whosoever is in the heavens and on the earth, i.e., the angels, mankind, Jinn, animals and even inanimate objects, all glorify Him. This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تُسَبِّحُ لَهُ السَّمَـوَتُ السَّبْعُ وَالاٌّرْضُ وَمَن فِيهِنَّ</div><p>(The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein, glorify Him) 17:44,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالطَّيْرُ صَآفَّـتٍ</div><p>(and the birds with wings outspread) means, while they are flying they glorify their Lord and worship Him with the glorification with which they are inspired and to which they are guided. Allah knows what they are doing, and so He says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلٌّ قَدْ عَلِمَ صَلاَتَهُ وَتَسْبِيحَهُ</div><p>(Of each one He knows indeed his Salah and his glorification;) meaning, He has guided every creature to its own way of worshipping Allah, may He be glorified. Then Allah tells us that He knows all of that and nothing at all is hidden from Him. He says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِمَا يَفْعَلُونَ</div><p>(and Allah is All-Aware of what they do.) Then Allah tells us that to Him belongs the sovereignty of heaven and earth, and that He is the Ruler and Controller, the God Who is worshipped and besides Whom none other is to be worshipped, and there is none to put back His judgement.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِلَى اللَّهِ الْمَصِيرُ</div><p>(and to Allah is the return) means, on the Day of Resurrection, when He will judge as He wills,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِيَجْزِىَ الَّذِينَ أَسَاءُواْ بِمَا عَمِلُواْ</div><p>(that He may requite those who do evil with that which they have done...) 53:31 He is the Creator and Sovereign, and His is indeed the Authority in this world and the next. To Him be praise at the beginning and in the end.</p>"
