Allah destroyed their king Nimrod, son of Canaan, son of Koch from Canaan, may Allah curse him, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وِأَصْحَـبِ مَدْيَنَ</div><p>(and the dwellers of Madyan), the people of Shu`ayb, peace be upon him, who were destroyed by the earthquake and the torment of the day of the Shade, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْمُؤْتَفِكَـتِ</div><p>(and the overturned cities), the people of Lut who used to live in Madyan. Allah said in another Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْمُؤْتَفِكَةَ أَهْوَى </div><p>(And He destroyed the overturned cities) 53:53, meaning the people of the overturned cities in reference to Sadum Sodom, their major city. Allah destroyed them all because they rejected Allah's Prophet Lut, peace be upon him, and because they committed the sin that none before them had committed homosexuality. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَتَتْهُمْ رُسُلُهُمْ بِالْبَيِّنَـتِ</div><p>(to them came their Messengers with clear proofs.), and unequivocal evidence, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَا كَانَ اللَّهُ لِيَظْلِمَهُمْ</div><p>(So it was not Allah Who wronged them), when He destroyed them, for He established the proofs against them by sending the Messengers and dissipating the doubts, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَـكِن كَانُواْ أَنفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ</div><p>(but they used to wrong themselves), on account of their denying the Messengers and defying the Truth; this is why they earned the end, torment and punishment, that they did. </p>"
