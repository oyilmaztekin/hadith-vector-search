    "text": "<h2>The Angels will disown Their Worshippers on the Day of Resurrection</h2><p>Allah tells us that on the Day of Resurrection, He will rebuke the idolators before all of creation. He will ask the angels whom the idolators used to worship, claiming that their idols were in the form of these angels and that they could bring them nearer to Allah. He will ask the angels:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَهَـؤُلاَءِ إِيَّاكُمْ كَانُواْ يَعْبُدُونَ</div><p>(Was it you that these people used to worship) meaning, `did you command them to worship you' Allah says in Surat Al-Furqan:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَءَنتُمْ أَضْلَلْتُمْ عِبَادِى هَـؤُلاَءِ أَمْ هُمْ ضَلُّوا السَّبِيلَ</div><p>(Was it you who misled these My servants or did they (themselves) stray from the (right) path) (25:17). And He will say to `Isa, peace be upon him:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَءَنتَ قُلتَ لِلنَّاسِ اتَّخِذُونِى وَأُمِّىَ إِلَـهَيْنِ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ قَالَ سُبْحَـنَكَ مَا يَكُونُ لِى أَنْ أَقُولَ مَا لَيْسَ لِى بِحَقٍّ</div><p>(Did you say unto men: \"Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allah,' He will say: \"Glory be to You! It was not for me to say what I had no right (to say).\") (5:116). Similarly, the angels will say:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سُبْحَـنَكَ</div><p>Glorified be You! meaning, exalted and sanctified be You above the notion that there could be any god besides You.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَنتَ وَلِيُّنَا مِن دُونِهِمْ</div><p>You are our Protector instead of them. means, we are Your servants and we disown these people before You.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلْ كَانُواْ يَعْبُدُونَ الْجِنَّ</div><p>(Nay, but they used to worship the Jinn;) meaning, the Shayatin, because they are the ones who made idol worship attractive to them and who misguided them.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَكْـثَرُهُم بِهِم مُّؤْمِنُونَ</div><p>most of them were believers in them. This is like the A0yah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِن يَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِهِ إِلاَّ إِنَـثاً وَإِن يَدْعُونَ إِلاَّ شَيْطَـناً مَّرِيداً لَّعَنَهُ اللَّهُ</div><p>(They invoke nothing but females besides Him, and they invoke nothing but Shaytan, a persistent rebel! Allah cursed him) (4:117-118). Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَالْيَوْمَ لاَ يَمْلِكُ بَعْضُكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ نَّفْعاً وَلاَ ضَرّاً</div><p>(So Today, none of you can profit or harm one another.) means, `none of those idols and rivals whom you hoped would benefit you, will be of any avail to you, those whom you worshipped in the hope that they would help you at times of stress and calamity. Today they will have no power either to benefit you or to harm you.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنَقُولُ لِلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ</div><p>And We shall say to those who did wrong: -- meaning the idolators --</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذُوقُواْ عَذَابَ النَّارِ الَّتِى كُنتُم بِهَا تُكَذِّبُونَ</div><p>(\"Taste the torment of the Fire which you used to deny.\") meaning, this will be said to them by way of rebuke.</p>"
