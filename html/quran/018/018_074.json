    "text": "<h2>The Story of killing the Boy</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَانطَلَقَا</div><p>(Then they both proceeded,) means, after the first incident,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَتَّى إِذَا لَقِيَا غُلاَمًا فَقَتَلَهُ</div><p>(till they met a boy, and he (Khidr) killed him.) It has been stated previously that this boy was playing with other boys in one of the towns, and that Al-Khidr deliberately singled him out. He was the finest and most handsome of them all, and Al-Khidr killed him. When Musa, peace be upon him, saw that he denounced him even more fervently than in the first case, and said hastily:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَقَتَلْتَ نَفْسًا زَكِيَّةً</div><p>(Have you killed an innocent person) meaning, a young person who had not yet committed any sin or done anything wrong, yet you killed him</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِغَيْرِ نَفْسٍ</div><p>(without Nafs) with no reason for killing him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّقَدْ جِئْتَ شَيْئاً نُّكْراً</div><p>(Verily, you have committed a thing Nukr!) meaning, something that is clearly evil.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ أَلَمْ أَقُلْ لَّكَ إِنَّكَ لَن تَسْتَطِيعَ مَعِىَ صَبْراً </div><p>(He said: \"Did I not tell you that you can have no patience with me\") Once again, Al-Khidr reiterates the condition set in the first place, so Musa says to him:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِن سَأَلْتُكَ عَن شَىْءٍ بَعْدَهَا</div><p>(If I ask you anything after this,) meaning, `if I object to anything else you do after this,'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ تُصَاحِبْنِى قَدْ بَلَغْتَ مِن لَّدُنِّى عُذْراً</div><p>(keep me not in your company, you have received an excuse from me.) `you have accepted my apology twice.' Ibn Jarir narrated from Ibn `Abbas that Ubayy bin Ka`b said: \"Whenever the Prophet mentioned anyone, he would pray for himself first. One day he said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«رَحْمَةُ اللهِ عَلَيْنَا وَعَلَى مُوسَى لَوْ لَبِثَ مَعَ صَاحِبِهِ لَأَبْصَرَ الْعَجَبَ، وَلَكِنَّهُ قَالَ:</div><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِن سَأَلْتُكَ عَن شَىْءٍ بَعْدَهَا فَلاَ تُصَاحِبْنِى قَدْ بَلَغْتَ مِن لَّدُنِّى عُذْراً»</div><p>(May the mercy of Allah be upon us and upon Musa. If he had stayed with his companion he would have seen wonders, but he said, (`If I ask you anything after this, keep me not in your company, you have received an excuse from me.'))\"</p>"
