Allah says;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَمْ يَأْتِكُمْ نَبَؤُاْ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِن قَبْلُ</div><p>(Has not the news reached you of those who disbelieved aforetime) meaning, information about them and what happened to them,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَذَاقُواْ وَبَالَ أَمْرِهِمْ</div><p>(And so they tasted the evil result of their disbelief.) They tasted the evil consequences of their denial and sinful actions. And it refers to the punishment and humiliation they received in the life of the world,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ</div><p>(and theirs will be a painful torment.) in the Hereafter, added to the torment they received in this life. Allah explained why;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذَلِكَ بِأَنَّهُ كَانَت تَّأْتِيهِمْ رُسُلُهُم بِالْبَيِّنَـتِ</div><p>(That was because there came to them their Messengers with Bayyinat,) supporting arguments, evidence, and clear proofs,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَقَالُواْ أَبَشَرٌ يَهْدُونَنَا</div><p>(but they said:\"Shall mere men guide us\") They discounted and dismissed the possibility that the Message would be sent to a human and that their guidance would come by the hands of a man like themselves,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَفَرُواْ وَتَوَلَّواْ</div><p>(So they disbelieved and turned away.) they denied the truth and turned away from abiding by it,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَّاسْتَغْنَى اللَّهُ</div><p>(But Allah was not in need.) of them,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاللَّهُ غَنِىٌّ حَمِيدٌ</div><p>(And Allah is not need, Worthy of all praise.)</p>"
