And whoever disbelieves, let not his disbelief grieve you.) means, `do not grieve over them, O Muhammad, because they disbelieve in Allah and in the Message you have brought, for their return will be to Allah and He will tell them what they used to do,' i.e., He will punish them for it.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ بِذَاتِ الصُّدُورِ</div><p>(Verily, Allah is the All-Knower of what is in the breasts.) and nothing whatsoever is hidden from Him. Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">نُمَتِّعُهُمْ قَلِيلاً</div><p>(We let them enjoy for a little while,) means, in this world,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ نَضْطَرُّهُمْ</div><p>(then in the end We shall oblige them) means, `We shall cause them,'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلَى عَذَابٍ غَلِيظٍ</div><p>(to (enter) a great torment.) means, a torment that is terrifying and difficult to bear. This is like the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَفْتَرُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ الْكَذِبَ لاَ يُفْلِحُونَ - مَتَـعٌ فِى الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ إِلَيْنَا مَرْجِعُهُمْ ثُمَّ نُذِيقُهُمُ الْعَذَابَ الشَّدِيدَ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَكْفُرُونَ </div><p>(\"Verily, those who invent a lie against Allah, will never be successful.\" Enjoyment in this world! and then unto Us will be their return, then We shall make them taste the severest torment because they used to disbelieve.) (10:69-70)</p>"
