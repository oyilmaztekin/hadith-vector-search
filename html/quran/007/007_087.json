    "text": "<h2>Prophet Shu`ayb forbade his people from setting up blockades on the roads, saying,</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَقْعُدُواْ بِكُلِّ صِرَطٍ تُوعِدُونَ</div><p>(\"And sit not on every road, threatening,\") threatening people with death if they do not give up their money, as they were bandits, according to As-Suddi. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and several others commented: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَقْعُدُواْ بِكُلِّ صِرَطٍ تُوعِدُونَ</div><p>(\"And sit not on every road, threatening.\") the believers who come to Shu`ayb to follow him.\" The first meaning is better, because Prophet Shu`ayb first said to them, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِكُلِّ صِرَطٍ</div><p>(\"on every road...\") He then mentioned the second meaning, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ مَنْ ءَامَنَ بِهِ وَتَبْغُونَهَا عِوَجًا</div><p>(\"and hindering from the path of Allah those who believe in Him, and seeking to make it crooked.\") meaning, you seek to make the path of Allah crooked and deviated, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاذْكُرُواْ إِذْ كُنتُمْ قَلِيلاً فَكَثَّرَكُمْ</div><p>(\"And remember when you were but few, and He multiplied you.\") meaning, you were weak because you were few. But you later on became mighty because of your large numbers. Therefore, remember Allah's favor. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَانظُرُواْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ الْمُفْسِدِينَ</div><p>(\"And see what was the end of the mischief-makers. \") from the previous nations and earlier generations. See the torment and punishment they suffered, because they disobeyed Allah and rejected His Messengers. Shu`ayb continued; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن كَانَ طَآئِفَةٌ مِّنكُمْ ءامَنُواْ بِالَّذِى أُرْسِلْتُ بِهِ وَطَآئِفَةٌ لَّمْ يْؤْمِنُواْ</div><p>(\"And if there is a party of you who believes in that with which I have been sent and a party who does not believe,\") that is, if you divided concerning me, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاصْبِرُواْ</div><p>(\"so be patient\") that is, then wait and see, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَتَّى يَحْكُمَ اللَّهُ بَيْنَنَا</div><p>(\"until Allah judges between us,\"), and you, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ خَيْرُ الْحَـكِمِينَ</div><p>(\"and He is the best of judges.\") Surely, Allah will award the best end to those who fear and obey Him and He will destroy the disbelievers. </p>"
