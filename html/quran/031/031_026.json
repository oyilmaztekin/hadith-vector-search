    "text": "<h2>The Idolators admitted that Allah is the Creator</h2><p>Allah tells us that these idolators who associated others with Him admitted that Allah Alone, with no partner or associate, is the Creator of heaven and earth yet they still worshipped others besides Him who they recognized were created by Him and subjugated to Him. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُمْ مَّنْ خَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ قُلِ الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ</div><p>(And if you ask them: \"Who has created the heavens and the earth,\" they will certainly say: \"Allah.\" Say: \"All the praises and thanks be to Allah!\") By their admitting that, proof is established against them,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(But most of them know not.) Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">للَّهِ مَا فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ</div><p>(To Allah belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth.) meaning, He created it and has dominion over it.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْغَنِىُّ الْحَمِيدُ</div><p>(Verily, Allah, He is Al-Ghani, Worthy of all praise.) means, He has no need of anyone or anything besides Himself, and everything else is in need of Him. He is Worthy of praise for all that He has created, so praise be to Him in the heavens and on earth for all that He has created and decreed, and He is worthy of praise in all affairs.</p>"
