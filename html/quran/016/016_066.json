    "text": "<h2>Lessons and Blessings in Cattle and the Fruit of the Date-palm and Grapevine</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّ لَكُمْ</div><p>(there is for you) - O mankind - </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فِى الاٌّنْعَـمِ</div><p>(in the cattle) - meaning camels, cows and sheep, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَعِبْرَةً</div><p>(a lesson) meaning a sign and an evidence of the wisdom, power, mercy and kindness of the Creator. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">نُّسْقِيكُمْ مِّمَّا فِى بُطُونِهِ</div><p>(We have made a drink for you out of what is in its belly) meaning its singular forms refers to one cattle, or it could refer to the whole species. For cattle are the creatures which provide a drink from what is in their bellies and in another Ayah it is `in their bellies.' Either way is plausible. He said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِن بَيْنِ فَرْثٍ وَدَمٍ لَّبَنًا خَالِصًا</div><p>(from between excretions and blood, pure milk;) meaning it is free of blood, and is pure in its whiteness, taste and sweetness. It is between excrement and blood in the belly of the animal, but each of them goes its own way after the food has been fully digested in its stomach. The blood goes to the veins, the milk goes to the udder, the urine goes to the bladder and the feces goes to the anus. None of them gets mixed with another after separating, and none of them is affected by the other. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّبَنًا خَالِصًا سَآئِغًا لِلشَّارِبِينَ</div><p>(pure milk; palatable to the drinkers.) meaning nothing to cause one to choke on it. When Allah mentions milk and how He has made it a palatable drink for mankind, He follows this with a reference to the drinks that people make from the fruits of the date palm and grapevine, and what they used to do with intoxicating Nabidh (drink made from dates) before it was forbidden. Thus He reminds them of His blessings, and says: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِن ثَمَرَتِ النَّخِيلِ وَالاٌّعْنَـبِ تَتَّخِذُونَ مِنْهُ سَكَرًا</div><p>(And from the fruits of date palms and grapes, you derive strong drink) This indicates that it was permissible to drink it before it was forbidden. It also indicates that strong drink (i.e., intoxicating drink) derived from dates is the same as strong drink derived from grapes. Also forbidden are strong drinks derived from wheat, barley, corn and honey, as is explained in detail in the Sunnah. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَكَرًا وَرِزْقًا حَسَنًا</div><p>(strong drink and a goodly provision.) Ibn `Abbas said: \"Strong drink is the product of these two fruits that is forbidden, and the good provision is what is permitted of them.\" According to another report: \"Strong drink is its unlawful, and the goodly provision is its lawful,\" referring to the fruits when they are dried, like dates and raisins, or products derived from them such as molasses, vinegar and wine (of grapes, dates) which are permissible to drink before they become strong (becomes alcoholic), as was stated in the Sunnah. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ فِى ذلِكَ لآيَةً لِّقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ</div><p>(There is indeed a sign in this for those of reason.) It is appropriate to mention reason here, because it is the noblest feature of man. Hence Allah forbade this Ummah from drinking intoxicants, in order to protect their ability to reason. Allah says: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلْنَا فِيهَا جَنَّـتٍ مِّن نَّخِيلٍ وَأَعْنَـبٍ وَفَجَّرْنَا فِيهَا مِنَ الْعُيُونِ - لِيَأْكُلُواْ مِن ثَمَرِهِ وَمَا عَمِلَتْهُ أَيْدِيهِمْ أَفَلاَ يَشْكُرُونَ - سُبْحَـنَ الَّذِى خَلَق الاٌّزْوَجَ كُلَّهَا مِمَّا تُنبِتُ الاٌّرْضُ وَمِنْ أَنفُسِهِمْ وَمِمَّا لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ </div><p>(And We placed gardens of date palms and grapes in it, and We caused springs of water to gush forth in it. So that they may eat of its fruit - while their hands did not make it. Will they not then give thanks Glory be to Him Who created all the pairs of that which the earth produces, as well as their own (human) kind (male and female), and of that which they know not.) (36:34-36) </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَوْحَى رَبُّكَ إِلَى النَّحْلِ أَنِ اتَّخِذِى مِنَ الْجِبَالِ بُيُوتًا وَمِنَ الشَّجَرِ وَمِمَّا يَعْرِشُونَ </div>"
