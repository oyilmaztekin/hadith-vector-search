    "text": "<h2>This World was created for a Wisdom</h2><p>Here Allah tells us of His justice, and that He is far above mere play, folly and falsehood. This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا خَلَقْنَا السَّمَآءَ وَالاٌّرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا بَـطِلاً ذَلِكَ ظَنُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنَ النَّارِ </div><p>(And We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them without purpose! That is the consideration of those who disbelieve! Then woe to those who disbelieve from the Fire!) (38:27)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَحَسِبْتُمْ أَنَّمَا خَلَقْنَـكُمْ عَبَثاً وَأَنَّكُمْ إِلَيْنَا لاَ تُرْجَعُونَ - فَتَعَـلَى اللَّهُ الْمَلِكُ الْحَقُّ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ رَبُّ الْعَرْشِ الْكَرِيمِ </div><p>(Did you think that We had created you in play, and that you would not be brought back to Us So Exalted be Allah, the True King: La ilaha illa Huwa, the Lord of the Supreme Throne!) (23:115-116) Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ يَوْمَ الْفَصْلِ مِيقَـتُهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ </div><p>(Verily, the Day of Judgement is the time appointed for all of them) This is the Day of Resurrection, when Allah will judge between all creatures, and He will punish the disbelievers and reward the believers.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِيقَـتُهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ</div><p>(is the time appointed for all of them) means, He will gather all of them, the first and the last of them.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَوْمَ لاَ يُغْنِى مَوْلًى عَن مَّوْلًى شَيْئاً</div><p>(The Day when a near relative cannot avail a near relative in aught,) means, no relative will be able to help another relative. This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِذَا نُفِخَ فِى الصُّورِ فَلاَ أَنسَـبَ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ وَلاَ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ </div><p>(Then, when the Trumpet is blown, there will be no kinship among them that Day, nor will they ask of one another.) (23:101)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَسْـَلُ حَمِيمٌ حَمِيماً يُبَصَّرُونَهُمْ</div><p>(And no friend will ask a friend (about his condition). Though they shall be made to see one another) (70:10-11) which means, he will not ask his brother about how he is, even though he can see him with his own eyes.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ هُمْ يُنصَرُونَ</div><p>(and no help can they receive,) means, no relative will help another, and no help will come to him from outside.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ مَن رَّحِمَ اللَّهُ</div><p>(Except him on whom Allah has mercy.) means, and nothing will be of any avail that Day except the mercy of Allah towards His creation.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ هُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الرَّحِيمُ</div><p>(Verily, He is the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful.) means, he is the Almighty, with immense mercy.</p>"
