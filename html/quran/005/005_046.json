    "text": "<h2>Allah Mentions `Isa and Praises the Injil</h2><p>Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَفَّيْنَا</div><p>(and We sent...) meaning, We sent</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِمْ</div><p>(in their footsteps) meaning the Prophets of the Children of Israel,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِعَيسَى ابْنِ مَرْيَمَ مُصَدِّقاً لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ مِنَ التَوْرَاةِ</div><p>(`Isa, son of Maryam, confirming the Tawrah that had come before him,) meaning, he believed in it and ruled by it.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَءَاتَيْنَـهُ الإِنجِيلَ فِيهِ هُدًى وَنُورٌ</div><p>(and We gave him the Injil, in which was guidance and light) a guidance that directs to the truth and a light that removes the doubts and solves disputes,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمُصَدِّقاً لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ مِنَ التَّوْرَاةِ</div><p>(and confirmation of the Tawrah that had come before it,) meaning, he adhered to the Tawrah, except for the few instances that clarified the truth where the Children of Israel differed. Allah states in another Ayah that `Isa said to the Children of Israel,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاٌّحِلَّ لَكُم بَعْضَ الَّذِي حُرِّمَ عَلَيْكُمْ</div><p>(. ..and to make lawful to you part of what was forbidden to you.) So the scholars say that the Injil abrogated some of the rulings of the Tawrah. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُدًى وَمَوْعِظَةٌ لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ</div><p>(a guidance and an admonition for those who have Taqwa.) means, We made the Injil guidance and an admonition that prohibits committing sins and errors, for those who have Taqwa of Allah and fear His warning and torment. Allah said next,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلْيَحْكُمْ أَهْلُ الإِنجِيلِ بِمَآ أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ فِيهِ</div><p>(Let the people of the Injil judge by what Allah has revealed therein.) meaning, so that He judges the people of the Injil by it in their time. Or, the Ayah means, so that they believe in all that is in it and adhere to all its commands, including the good news about the coming of Muhammad and the command to believe in and follow him when he is sent. Allah said in other Ayat,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ يَـأَهْلَ الْكِتَـبِ لَسْتُمْ عَلَى شَىْءٍ حَتَّى تُقِيمُواْ التَّوْرَاةَ وَالإِنجِيلَ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكُمْ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ</div><p>(Say \"O People of the Scripture! You have nothing (guidance) until you act according to the Tawrah, the Injil, and what has been sent down to you from your Lord.\") and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِينَ يَتَّبِعُونَ الرَّسُولَ النَّبِىَّ الأُمِّىَّ الَّذِى يَجِدُونَهُ مَكْتُوبًا عِندَهُمْ فِى التَّوْرَاةِ</div><p>(Those who follow the Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write whom they find written with them in the Tawrah...) until,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الْمُفْلِحُونَ</div><p>(...successful.) Here, Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن لَّمْ يَحْكُم بِمَآ أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ فَأُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْفَـسِقُونَ</div><p>(And whosoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed, such are the rebellious.) meaning, the rebellious and disobedient of Allah who prefer falsehood and abandon truth. We mentioned before that this Ayah was revealed about the Christians, and this is evident from the context of the Ayah.</p>"
