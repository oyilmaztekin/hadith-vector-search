    "text": "<h2>Allah's Perfect Power</h2>\n<p>Allah the Exalted asserts His perfect power and infinite greatness, so that the great religion that He has legislated is honored and implemented,</p>\n<div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اللَّهُ الَّذِى خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمَـوَتٍ</div>\n<p>(It is Allah Who has created seven heavens) Allah said in similar Ayat, like what Prophet Nuh said to his people,</p>\n<div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَمْ تَرَوْاْ كَيْفَ خَلَقَ اللَّهُ سَبْعَ سَمَـوَتٍ طِبَاقاً</div>\n<p>(See you not how Allah has created the seven heavens one above another) (71:15), and,</p>\n<div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تُسَبِّحُ لَهُ ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٰتُ ٱلسَّبْعُ وَٱلْأَرْضُ وَمَن فِيهِنَّ</div>\n<p>(The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein, glorify him.) (17:44) Allah's statement,</p>\n<div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِنَ ٱلْأَرْضِ مِثْلَهُنَّ</div>\n<p>(and of the earth the like thereof.) means, He created seven earths. In the Two Sahihs, there is a Hadith that states,</p>\n<div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ ظَلَمَ قِيدَ شِبْرٍ مِنَ الْأَرْضِ طُوِّقَهُ مِنْ سَبْعِ أَرَضِين»</div>\n<p>(Whoever usurps the land of somebody unjustly, even if it was a mere hand span, then his neck will be encircled with it down to the seven earths.) And in Sahih Al-Bukhari the wording is:</p>\n<div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«خُسِفَ بِهِ إِلَى سَبْعِ أَرَضِين»</div>\n<p>(...he will sink down to the seven earths.) In the beginning of my book, Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah, I mentioned the various narrations for this Hadith when I narrated the story of the creation of the earth. All the thanks and praise is due to Allah. Those who explained this Hadith to mean the seven continents have brought an implausible explanation that contradicts the letter of the Qur'an and the Hadith without having proof. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat At-Talaq, all the thanks and praise is due to Allah.</p>"
