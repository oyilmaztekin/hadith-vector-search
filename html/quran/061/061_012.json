    "text": "<h2>The Trade that saves One from the Painful Torment</h2><p>We mentioned a Hadith from `Abdullah bin Salam in that the Companions wanted to ask the Prophet of Allah about the best actions with Allah the Exalted and Most Honored, so they could practice them. Allah the Exalted sent down this Surah, including this Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ هَلْ أَدُلُّكمْ عَلَى تِجَـرَةٍ تُنجِيكُم مِّنْ عَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ </div><p>(O you who believe! Shall I guide you to a trade that will save you from a painful torment) Allah then explained this great trade that will never fail, the trade that will earn one what he wishes and saves him from what he dislikes. Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ وَتُجَـهِدُونَ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ بِأَمْوَلِكُمْ وَأَنفُسِكُمْ ذَلِكُمْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ </div><p>(That you believe in Allah and His Messenger, and that you strive hard and fight in the cause of Allah with your wealth and your lives, that will be better for you, if you but know!) this is better than the trade of this life and striving hard for it and amassing it. Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ ذُنُوبَكُمْ</div><p>(He will forgive you your sins,) meaning, `if you fulfill what I commanded you and guided you to, then I will forgive your sins and admit you into the Gardens of Paradise. In them, you will have exalted residences and high postitions.' This is why Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيُدْخِلْكُمْ جَنَّـتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَـرُ وَمَسَـكِنَ طَيِّبَةً فِى جَنَّـتِ عَدْنٍ ذَلِكَ الْفَوْزُ الْعَظِيمُ</div><p>(and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow, and pleasant dwellings in `Adn (Eternal) Paradise; that is indeed the great success.) Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأُخْرَى تُحِبُّونَهَا</div><p>(And also another (blessing) which you love,) meaning, `I will grant you more favors that you like,'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">نَصْرٌ مِّن اللَّهِ وَفَتْحٌ قَرِيبٌ</div><p>(help from Allah and a near victory.) meaning, if you fight in Allah's cause and support His religion, He will grant you victory. Allah the Exalted said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يأَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ إِن تَنصُرُواْ اللَّهَ يَنصُرْكُمْ وَيُثَبِّتْ أَقْدَامَكُمْ </div><p>(O you who believe! If you help (in the cause of) Allah, He will help you, and make your foothold firm.) (47:7), and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَيَنصُرَنَّ اللَّهُ مَن يَنصُرُهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَقَوِىٌّ عَزِيزٌ</div><p>(Verily, Allah will help those who help His (cause). Truly, Allah is All Strong, All-Wise.) (22:40) Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفَتْحٌ قَرِيبٌ</div><p>(and a near victory.) means, it will come sooner, and this is the increased favor that is earned in this life and continues, becoming the delight of the Hereafter. It is for those who obey Allah and His Messenger and support Allah and His religion. Allah said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَبَشِّرِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</div><p>(And give glad tidings to the believers.)</p>"
