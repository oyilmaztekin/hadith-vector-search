    "text": "<h2>Refutation of Their Accusation that the Prophet was Insane</h2><p>Allah says: `Say, O Muhammad, to these disbelievers who claim that you are crazy,'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّمَآ أَعِظُكُمْ بِوَحِدَةٍ</div><p>I exhort you to one (thing) only, meaning, I am only telling you to one thing, and that is:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَن تَقُومُواْ لِلَّهِ مَثْنَى وَفُرَادَى ثُمَّ تَتَفَكَّرُواْ مَا بِصَـحِبِكُمْ مِّن جِنَّةٍ</div><p>that you stand up for Allah s sake in pairs and singly, and reflect, there is no madness in your companion. meaning, `stand sincerely before Allah, without being influenced by your own desires or tribal feelings, and ask one another, is Muhammad crazy Advise one another,'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ تَتَفَكَّرُواْ</div><p>and reflect means, let each person look within himself concerning the matter of Muhلammad , and ask other people about him if he is still confused, then let him think about the matter. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَن تَقُومُواْ لِلَّهِ مَثْنَى وَفُرَادَى ثُمَّ تَتَفَكَّرُواْ مَا بِصَـحِبِكُمْ مِّن جِنَّةٍ</div><p>(that you stand up for Allah's sake in pairs and singly, and reflect, there is no madness in your companion.) This meaning was stated by Mujahid, Muhammad bin Ka`b, As-Suddi, Qatadah and others. This is what is meant by the Ayah.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ نَذِيرٌ لَّكُمْ بَيْنَ يَدَىْ عَذَابٍ شَدِيدٍ</div><p>(He is only a warner to you in face of a severe torment.) Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, commented on this Ayah: \"One day, the Prophet climbed up As-Safa' and shouted,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يَا صَبَاحَاه»</div><p>(O people!) The Quraysh gathered around him, and said, `What is the matter with you' He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«أَرَأَيْتُمْ لَوْ أَخْبَرْتُكُمْ أَنَّ الْعَدُوَّ يُصَبِّحُكُمْ أَوْ يُمَسِّيكُمْ أَمَا كُنْتُمْ تُصَدِّقُونِّي»</div><p>(What do you think If I told you that the enemy were approaching and will reach us in the morning or in the evening, would you believe me) They said, `Of course.' He said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«فَإِنِّي نَذِيرٌ لَكُمْ بَيْنَ يَدَيْ عَذَابٍ شَدِيد»</div><p>(I am a warner to you in the face of a severe punishment.) Abu Lahab said, `May you perish! You have called us together only to tell us this' Then Allah revealed:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تَبَّتْ يَدَآ أَبِى لَهَبٍ وَتَبَّ </div><p>(Perish the two hands of Abu Lahab and perish he!) (111:1) We have already discussed this in our Tafsir of the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنذِرْ عَشِيرَتَكَ الاٌّقْرَبِينَ </div><p>(And warn your tribe of near kindred) (26:214).</p>"
