    "text": "<h2>The Idolators ask for a Miracle</h2><p>Allah states that out of their disbelief and stubbornness, the idolators asked why is not a miracle sent down to the Messenger from his Lord, just like the earlier Messengers For instance, the disbelievers were being stubborn when they asked the Prophet to turn As-Safa into gold, to remove the mountains from around them, and to replace them with green fields and rivers. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا مَنَعَنَآ أَن نُّرْسِلَ بِالاٌّيَـتِ إِلاَّ أَن كَذَّبَ بِهَا الاٌّوَّلُونَ</div><p>(And nothing stops Us from sending the Ayat but that the people of old denied them.)17:59 Allah said here,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّمَآ أَنتَ مُنذِرُ</div><p>(You are only a warner), and your duty is only to convey Allah's Message which He has ordered you,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّيْسَ عَلَيْكَ هُدَاهُمْ وَلَـكِنَّ اللَّهَ يَهْدِى مَن يَشَآءُ</div><p>(Not upon you is their guidance, but Allah guides whom He wills.)2:272 Allah said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلِكُلِّ قَوْمٍ هَادٍ</div><p>(And to every people there is a guide.) meaning that for every people there has been a caller, according to Ibn `Abbas and as narrated from him by Ali bin Abi Talhah. Allah said in a similar Ayah, a</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن مِّنْ أُمَّةٍ إِلاَّ خَلاَ فِيهَا نَذِيرٌ</div><p>(And there never was a nation but a warner had passed among them.)35:24 Similar has reported from Qatadah and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">اللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ مَا تَحْمِلُ كُلُّ أُنثَى وَمَا تَغِيضُ الاٌّرْحَامُ وَمَا تَزْدَادُ وَكُلُّ شَىْءٍ عِندَهُ بِمِقْدَارٍ - عَـلِمُ الْغَيْبِ وَالشَّهَـدَةِ الْكَبِيرُ الْمُتَعَالِ </div>"
