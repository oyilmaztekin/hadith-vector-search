Allah said in other Ayat,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذْ يَمْكُرُ بِكَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ لِيُثْبِتُوكَ أَوْ يَقْتُلُوكَ أَوْ يُخْرِجُوكَ وَيَمْكُرُونَ وَيَمْكُرُ اللَّهُ وَاللَّهُ خَيْرُ الْمَـكِرِينَ </div><p>(And (remember) when the disbelievers plotted against you to imprison you, or to kill you, or to get you out; they were plotting and Allah too was plotting; and Allah is the Best of those who plot.) 8:30, and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَكَرُواْ مَكْراً وَمَكَرْنَا مَكْراً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ - فَانظُرْ كَيْفَ كَانَ عَـقِبَةُ مَكْرِهِمْ أَنَّا دَمَّرْنَـهُمْ وَقَوْمَهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ </div><p>(So they plotted a plot, and We planned a plan, while they perceived not. Then see how was the end of their plot! Verily, We destroyed them and their nation, all together.)27:50,51 Allah said next,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَعْلَمُ مَا تَكْسِبُ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ</div><p>(He knows what every person earns,) meaning, He alone knows all secrets and concealed thoughts and will reckon each person according to his work, (</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَسَيَعْلَمُ الْكَـفِرُ</div><p>and the Kafir (disbeliever) will know</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الْكُفَّـرُ</div><p>or the Kuffar (disbelievers) according to another way of reciting,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِمَنْ عُقْبَى الدَّارِ</div><p>(who gets the good end.) who will earn the ultimate and final victory, they or the followers of the Messengers. Indeed, the followers of the Messengers will earn the good end in this life and the Hereafter, all thanks and praise is due to Allah.</p>"
