    "text": "<h2>The Covenant of the Prophets</h2><p>Allah tells us about the five Mighty Messengers with strong resolve and the other Prophets, how He took a covenant from them to establish the religion of Allah and convey His Message, and to cooperate and support one another, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذْ أَخَذَ اللَّهُ مِيثَـقَ النَّبِيِّيْنَ لَمَآ ءَاتَيْتُكُم مِّن كِتَـبٍ وَحِكْمَةٍ ثُمَّ جَآءَكُمْ رَسُولٌ مُّصَدِّقٌ لِّمَا مَعَكُمْ لَتُؤْمِنُنَّ بِهِ وَلَتَنصُرُنَّهُ قَالَ ءَأَقْرَرْتُمْ وَأَخَذْتُمْ عَلَى ذلِكُمْ إِصْرِى قَالُواْ أَقْرَرْنَا قَالَ فَاشْهَدُواْ وَأَنَاْ مَعَكُمْ مِّنَ الشَّـهِدِينَ </div><p>(And when Allah took the covenant of the Prophets, saying: \"Take whatever I gave you from the Book and Hikmah, and afterwards there will come to you a Messenger confirming what is with you; you must, then, believe in him and help him.\" Allah said: \"Do you agree, and will you take up My covenant\" They said: \"We agree.\" He said: \"Then bear witness; and I am with you among the witnesses.\") (3:81) This covenant was taken from them after their missions started. Elsewhere in the Qur'an, Allah mentions five by name, and these are the Mighty Messengers with strong resolve. They are also mentioned by name in this Ayah and in the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">شَرَعَ لَكُم مِّنَ الِدِينِ مَا وَصَّى بِهِ نُوحاً وَالَّذِى أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ وَمَا وَصَّيْنَا بِهِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَمُوسَى وَعِيسَى أَنْ أَقِيمُواْ الدِّينَ وَلاَ تَتَفَرَّقُواْ فِيهِ</div><p>(He (Allah) has ordained for you the same religion which He ordained for Nuh, and that which We have revealed to you, and that which We ordained for Ibrahim, Musa and `Isa saying you should establish religion and make no divisions in it.) (42:13) This is the covenant which Allah took from them, as He says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذْ أَخَذْنَا مِنَ النَّبِيِّيْنَ مِيثَاقَهُمْ وَمِنْكَ وَمِن نُّوحٍ وَإِبْرَهِيمَ وَمُوسَى وَعِيسَى ابْنِ مَرْيَمَ</div><p>(And when We took from the Prophets their covenant, and from you, and from Nuh, Ibrahim, Musa, and `Isa son of Maryam.) This Ayah begins with the last Prophet, as a token of respect, may the blessings of Allah be upon him, then the names of the other Prophets are given in order, may the blessings of Allah be upon them. Ibn `Abbas said: \"The strong covenant is Al-`Ahd (the covenant).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِّيَسْأَلَ الصَّـدِقِينَ عَن صِدْقِهِمْ</div><p>(That He may ask the truthful about their truth.) Mujahid said: \"This refers to, those who convey the Message from the Messengers.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَعَدَّ لِلْكَـفِرِينَ</div><p>(And He has prepared for the disbelievers) i.e., among their nations,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَذَاباً أَلِيماً</div><p>(a painful torment.) i.e., agonizing. We bear witness that the Messengers did indeed convey the Message of their Lord and advised their nations, and that they clearly showed them the truth in which there is no confusion, doubt or ambiguity, even though they were rejected by the ignorant, stubborn and rebellious wrongdoers. What the Messengers brought is the truth, and whoever opposes them is misguided. As the people of Paradise will say:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَقَدْ جَآءَتْ رُسُلُ رَبِّنَا بِالْحَقِّ</div><p>(Indeed, the Messengers of our Lord did come with the truth.) (7:43)</p>"
