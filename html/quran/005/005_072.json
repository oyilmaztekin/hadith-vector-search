    "text": "<h2>The Disbelief of the Christians; `Isa Only called to Tawhid</h2><p>Allah states that the Christians such sects as Monarchite, Jacobite and Nestorite are disbelievers, those among them who say that `Isa is Allah. Allah is far holier than what they attribute to Him. They made this claim in spite of the fact that `Isa made it known that he was the servant of Allah and His Messenger. The first words that `Isa uttered when he was still a baby in the cradle were, \"I am `Abdullah (the servant of Allah).\" He did not say, \"I am Allah,\" or, \"I am the son of Allah.\" Rather, he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنِّى عَبْدُ اللَّهِ ءَاتَانِىَ الْكِتَـبَ وَجَعَلَنِى نَبِيّاً</div><p>(Verily, I am a servant of Allah, He has given me the Scripture and made me a Prophet.) until he said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ رَبِّى وَرَبُّكُمْ فَاعْبُدُوهُ هَـذَا صِرَطٌ مُّسْتَقِيمٌ </div><p>(\"And verily Allah is my Lord and your Lord. So worship Him (Alone). That is the straight path.\") He also proclaimed to them when he was a man, after he was sent as a Prophet, commanding them to worship his Lord and their Lord, alone without partners,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالَ الْمَسِيحُ يَابَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ رَبُّى وَرَبَّكُمْ إِنَّهُ مَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ</div><p>(But the Messiah said, \"O Children of Israel! worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.\" Verily, whosoever sets up partners with Allah...) in worship;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَقَدْ حَرَّمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيهِ الْجَنَّةَ وَمَأْوَاهُ النَّارُ</div><p>(. ..then Allah has forbidden Paradise for him, and the Fire will be his abode.) as He will send him to the Fire and forbid Paradise for him. Allah also said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَلِكَ لِمَن يَشَآءُ</div><p>(Verily, Allah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills.) and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنَادَى أَصْحَـبُ النَّارِ أَصْحَـبَ الْجَنَّةِ أَنْ أَفِيضُواْ عَلَيْنَا مِنَ الْمَآءِ أَوْ مِمَّا رَزَقَكُمُ اللَّهُ قَالُواْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ حَرَّمَهُمَا عَلَى الْكَـفِرِينَ </div><p>(And the dwellers of the Fire will call to the dwellers of Paradise; \"Pour on us some water or anything that Allah has provide you with.\" They will say: \"Allah has forbidden both to the disbelievers.\") It is recorded in the Sahih that the Prophet had someone proclaim to the people,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ الْجَنَّةَ لَا يَدْخُلُهَا إِلَّا نَفْسٌ مُسْلِمَة»</div><p>(Only a Muslim soul shall enter Paradise.) In another narration,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مُؤْمِنَة»</div><p>(Only a believing soul...) This is why Allah said that `Isa said to the Children of Israel,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ مَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَقَدْ حَرَّمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيهِ الْجَنَّةَ وَمَأْوَاهُ النَّارُ وَمَا لِلظَّـلِمِينَ مِنْ أَنصَارٍ</div><p>(Verily, whosoever sets up partners with Allah, then Allah has forbidden Paradise for him, and the Fire will be his abode. And there are no helpers for the wrongdoers.) There is no help from Allah, nor anyone who will support or protect them from the state they will be in. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّقَدْ كَفَرَ الَّذِينَ قَالُواْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ ثَـلِثُ ثَلَـثَةٍ</div><p>(Surely, they have disbelieved who say: \"Allah is the third of three.\") Mujahid and several others said that this Ayah was revealed about the Christians in particular. As-Suddi and others said that this Ayah was revealed about taking `Isa and his mother as gods besides Allah, thus making Allah the third in a trinity. As-Suddi said, \"This is similar to Allah's statement towards the end of the Surah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذْ قَالَ اللَّهُ يعِيسَى ابْنَ مَرْيَمَ أَءَنتَ قُلتَ لِلنَّاسِ اتَّخِذُونِى وَأُمِّىَ إِلَـهَيْنِ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ قَالَ سُبْحَـنَكَ</div><p>(And (remember) when Allah will say: \"O `Isa, son of Maryam! Did you say unto men: `Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allah' He will say, \"Glory be to You!\")5:116. Allah replied,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا مِنْ إِلَـهٍ إِلاَّ إِلَـهٌ وَحِدٌ</div><p>(But there is no god but One God.) meaning there are not many worthy of worship but there is only One God without partners, and He is the Lord of all creation and all that exists. Allah said next, while threatening and admonishing them,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن لَّمْ يَنتَهُواْ عَمَّا يَقُولُونَ</div><p>(And if they cease not from what they say, ) their lies and false claims,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَيَمَسَّنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنْهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ</div><p>(verily, a painful torment will befall the disbelievers among them.) in the Hereafter, shackled and tormented. Allah said next,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَفَلاَ يَتُوبُونَ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَيَسْتَغْفِرُونَهُ وَاللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ </div><p>(Will they not repent to Allah and ask His Forgiveness For Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) This demonstrates Allah's generosity, kindness and mercy for His creatures, even though they committed this grave sin and invented such a lie and false allegation. Despite all of this, Allah calls them to repent so that He will forgive them, for Allah forgives those who sincerely repent to Him.</p><h2>`Isa is Allah's Servant and His Mother is a Truthful Believer</h2><p>Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّا الْمَسِيحُ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ إِلاَّ رَسُولٌ قَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِهِ الرُّسُلُ</div><p>(The Messiah, son of Maryam, was no more than a Messenger; many were the Messengers that passed away before him.) `Isa is just like the previous Prophets, and he is one of the servants of Allah and one of His honorable Messengers. Allah said in another Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ عَبْدٌ أَنْعَمْنَا عَلَيْهِ وَجَعَلْنَـهُ مَثَلاً لِّبَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ </div><p>(He `Isa was not more than a servant. We granted Our favor to him, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel.) Allah said next,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأُمُّهُ صِدِّيقَةٌ</div><p>(His mother was a Siddiqah) for she believed in Allah with complete trust in Him. This is the highest rank she was given, which proves that she was not a Prophet. Allah said next,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَانَا يَأْكُلاَنِ الطَّعَامَ</div><p>(They both used to eat food) needing nourishment and to relieve the call of nature. Therefore, they are just servants like other servants, not gods as ignorant Christian sects claim, may Allah's continued curses cover them until the Day of Resurrection. Allah said next,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">انْظُرْ كَيْفَ نُبَيِّنُ لَهُمُ الاٌّيَـتِ</div><p>(Look how We make the Ayat clear to them. ) making them unequivocal and plain,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ انْظُرْ أَنَّى يُؤْفَكُونَ</div><p>(yet look how they are deluded away (from the truth).) look at the opinions, misguided ideas, and claims they cling to, even after Our clarification and plain, unequivocal explanation.</p>"
