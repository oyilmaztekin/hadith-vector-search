    "text": "<p>Mujahid said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِئْسَمَا اشْتَرَوْاْ بِهِ أَنفُسَهُمْ</div><p>(How bad is that for which they have sold their own selves), \"The Jews sold the truth for falsehood and hid the truth about Muhammad .\" As-Suddi said that the Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِئْسَمَا اشْتَرَوْاْ بِهِ أَنفُسَهُمْ</div><p>(How bad is that for which they have sold their own selves) means, \"The Jews sold themselves.\" meaning, what is worse is what they chose for themselves by disbelieving in what Allah revealed to Muhammad instead of believing, aiding and supporting him. This behavior of theirs is the result of their injustice, envy and hatred, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَن يُنَزِّلُ اللَّهُ مِن فَضْلِهِ عَلَى مَن يَشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ</div><p>(grudging that Allah should reveal of His grace unto whom He wills of His servants). \" There is no envy worse than this. Therefore, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَبَآءُو بِغَضَبٍ عَلَى غَضَبٍ</div><p>(So they have drawn on themselves wrath upon wrath). Ibn `Abbas commented on this Ayah, \"Allah became angry with them because they ignored some of the Tawrah and disbelieved in the Prophet that He sent to them.\" I (Ibn Kathir) say that the meaning of, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَاءُوا</div><p>(And they drew on themselves) is that they deserved and acquired multiplied anger. Also, Abu Al-`Aliyah said, \"Allah became angry with them, because of their disbelief in the Injil and `Isa and He became angry with them again, because they disbelieved in Muhammad and the Qur'an.\" Similar was said by `Ikrimah and Qatadah. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلِلْكَـفِرِينَ عَذَابٌ مُّهِينٌ</div><p>(And for the disbelievers, there is disgracing torment). Since their disbelief was a result of their transgression and envy, which was caused by arrogance, they were punished with disgrace and humiliation in this world and the Hereafter. Similarly, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِى سَيَدْخُلُونَ جَهَنَّمَ دَخِرِينَ</div><p>(Verily, those who scorn My worship (i.e. do not invoke Me, and do not believe in My Oneness) they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!\") (40:60) meaning, \"Disgraced, degraded and humiliated.\" Imam Ahmad narrated that `Amr bin Shu`ayb said that his father said that his grandfather said that the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«يُحْشَرُ الْمُتَكَبِّرُونَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ أَمْثَالَ الذَّرِّ فِي صُوَرِ النَّاسِ، يَعْلُوهُمْ كُلُّ شَيْءٍ مِنَ الصِّغَارِ حَتَّى يَدْخُلُوا سِجْنًا فِي جَهَنَّمَ يُقَالُ لَهُ. بَوْلَسُ تَعْلُوهُمْ نَارُ الْأَنْيَارِ يُسْقَونَ مِنْ طِينَةِ الْخَبَالِ عُصَارَةِ أَهْلِ النَّار»</div><p>(The arrogant people will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection in the size of ants, but in the shape of men. Everything shall be above them, because of the humiliation placed on them, until they enter a prison in Jahannam called `Bawlas' where the fire will surround them from above. They shall drink from the puss of the people of the Fire.) </p>"
