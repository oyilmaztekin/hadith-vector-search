    "text": "<p>ائْذَن لِّي</p><p>(Grant me leave), to stay behind,</p><p>وَلاَ تَفْتِنِّى</p><p>(and put me not into trial.), if I go with you and see the women of the Romans. Allah, the Exalted, replied,</p><p>أَلا فِى الْفِتْنَةِ سَقَطُواْ</p><p>(Surely, they have fallen into trial) because of the statement they uttered. Muhammad bin Ishaq reported from Az-Zuhri, Yazid bin Ruwman, `Abdullah bin Abi Bakr, `Asim bin Qatadah and several others that they said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to Al-Jadd bin Qays from Bani Salimah,</p><p>«هَلْ لَكَ يَا جَدُّ الْعَامَ فِي جَلَادِ بَنِي الْأَصْفَرِ؟»</p><p>(`Would you like to fight the yellow ones (Romans) this year) He said, `O Allah's Messenger! Give me permission (to remain behind) and do not cause Fitnah for me. By Allah! My people know that there is not a man who is more fond of women than I. I fear that if I see the women of the yellow ones, I would not be patient.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ turned away from him and said,</p><p>«قَدْ أَذِنْتُ لَك»</p><p>(I give you permission.) In Al-Jadd's case, this Ayah was revealed,</p><p>وَمِنْهُمْ مَّن يَقُولُ ائْذَن لِّي وَلاَ تَفْتِنِّى</p><p>(And among them is he who says: \"Grant me leave and put me not into trial.\") Therefore, Allah says that the Fitnah that he fell into because of not joining the Messenger of Allah ﷺ (in Jihad) and preferring his safety to the safety of the Messenger ﷺ is worse than the Fitnah that he falsely claimed to fear.\" It was reported from Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and several others that this Ayah was revealed in the case of Al-Jadd bin Qays, who was among the chiefs of Bani Salimah. It is also recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ asked,</p><p>«مَنْ سَيِّدُكُمْ يَا بَنِي سَلَمَةَ؟»</p><p>(Who is your chief, O Bani Salamah) They said, \"Al-Jadd bin Qays, although we consider him a miser.\" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«وَأَيُّ دَاءٍ أَدْوَأُ مِنَ الْبُخْلِ وَلَكِنْ سَيِّدُكُمْ الْفَتَى الْجَعْدُ الْأَبْيَضُ بِشْرُ بْنُ الْبَرَاءِ بْنِ مَعْرُور»</p><p>(There is not a disease worse than stinginess! Therefore, your chief is the white young man with curly hair, Bishr bin Al-Bara' bin Ma'rur.) Allah said next,</p><p>وَإِنَّ جَهَنَّمَ لَمُحِيطَةٌ بِالْكَـفِرِينَ</p><p>(And verily, Hell is surrounding the disbelievers.) and they will never be able to avoid, avert, or escape from it.</p>"
