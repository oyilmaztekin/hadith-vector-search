    "text": "<h2>Jahannam and Paradise and their Dwellers</h2><p>Allah states that He will say to Jahannam on the Day of Resurrection, \"Have you had your fill\" Allah the Most Honored has promised Hell that it will have its fill from the Jinns and mankind. He, the Exalted and Most Honored, will decide who will be thrown into the Fire and she will keep saying, \"Are there any more,\" or, `Are there any more whom You will provide me with' This is the apparent meaning of this Ayah which is supported by several Hadiths. Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَا تَزَالُ جَهَنَّمُ يُلْقَى فِيهَا وَتَقُولُ: هَلْ مِنْ مَزِيدٍ؟ حَتْى يَضَعَ رَبُّ الْعِزَّةِ قَدَمَهُ فِيهَا، فَيَنْزَوِي بَعْضُهَا إِلَى بَعْضٍ وَتَقُولُ: قَطْ قَطْ وَعِزَّتِكَ وَكَرَمِكَ. وَلَا يَزَالُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ فَضْلٌ حَتْى يُنْشِىءَ اللهُ لَهَا خَلْقًا آخَرَ فَيُسْكِنَهُمُ اللهُ تَعَالَى فِي فُضُولِ الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(The people will be thrown into Jahannam and it will say, `Are there any more' Until the Mighty Lord puts His Foot over it and its corners will be collected together and it will say, \"Enough, enough by Your grace and compassion!' There will be sufficient empty space in Paradise until Allah creates another creation and He, the Exalted, makes them dwell in the empty parts of Paradise.)\" Muslim also collected this Hadith. Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet said,</p><p>«يُقَالُ لِجَهَنَّمَ هَلِ امْتَلَأْتِ؟ وَتَقُولُ: هَلْ مِنْ مَزِيدٍ؟ فَيَضَعُ الرَّبُّ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى قَدَمَهُ عَلَيْهَا فَتَقُولُ: قَطْ قَط»</p><p>(Jahannam will be asked, \"Are you full\" and it will say, \"Are there any more\" Until the Lord, the Blessed and Most Honored, puts His Foot over it and it will say: \"Enough! Enough!\") Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«تَحَاجَّتِ الْجَنَّةُ وَالنَّارُ فَقَالَتِ النَّارُ: أُوثِرْتُ بِالْمُتَكَبِّرِينَ وَالْمُتَجَبِّرِينَ. وَقَالَتِ الْجَنَّةُ: مَالِي لَا يَدْخُلُنِي إِلَّا ضُعَفَاءُ النَّاسِ وَسَقَطُهُمْ. قَالَ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ لِلْجَنَّةِ: أَنْتِ رَحْمَتِي أَرْحَمُ بِكِ مَنْ أَشَاءُ مِنْ عِبَادِي . وَقَالَ لِلنَّارِ: إِنَّمَا أَنْتِ عَذَابِي أُعَذِّبُ بِكِ مَنْ أَشَاءُ مِنْ عِبَادِي وَلِكُلِّ وَاحِدَةٍ مِنْكُمَا مِلْؤُهَا، فَأَمَّا النَّارُ فَلَا تَمْتَلِىءُ حَتْى يَضَعَ رِجْلَهُ فِيهَا فَتَقُولُ: قَطْ قَطْ، فَهُنَالِكَ تَمْتَلِىءُ وَيَنْزَوِي بَعْضُهَا إِلَى بَعْضٍ وَلَا يَظْلِمُ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ مِنْ خَلْقِهِ أَحَدًا، وَأَمَّا الْجَنَّةُ فَإِنَّ اللهَ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ يُنْشِىءُ لَهَا خَلْقًا آخَر»</p><p>(Paradise and the Fire quarreled. The Fire said, \"I have been favored with the arrogant people and tyrants.\" Paradise said, \"What is wrong with me that only the poor and humble people enter me\" Allah the Exalted and Most Honored said to Paradise, \"You are My mercy, with which I grant mercy to those whom I will among My servants.\" He said to Hell, \"You are My punishment which I inflict upon whom I wish from My servants, and I shall fill both of you.\" As for Hellfire, it will not have its fill until Allah puts His Foot over it and she will say, \"Enough! Enough!\" She will become full and its sides will come close to each other. Allah the Exalted and Most Honored shall not be unjust to any one of His creatures. As for Paradise, Allah the Exalted and Most Honored will create another creation to fill it.) Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>وَأُزْلِفَتِ الْجَنَّةُ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ غَيْرَ بَعِيدٍ</p><p>(And Paradise will be Uzlifat to those who had Taqwa, not far off.) meaning, Paradise will be brought close and near to the pious, according to Qatadah, Abu Malik and As-Suddi,</p><p>غَيْرَ بَعِيدٍ</p><p>(not far off), and this will occur on the Day of Resurrection, which is not far off. Surely that Day will come to pass and all that is bound to come, is near,</p><p>هَـذَا مَا تُوعَدُونَ لِكُلِّ أَوَّابٍ</p><p>(This is what you were promised -- (it is) for those returning) who go back to Allah in sincere repentance intending not to repeat sin,</p><p>حَفِيظٌ</p><p>(Hafiz), who preserve their covenant with Allah and do not break or betray it,</p><p>مَّنْ خَشِىَ الرَّحْمَـنَ بِالْغَيْبِ</p><p>(Who feared Ar-Rahman unseen) who feared Allah in secret when only Allah the Exalted and Most Honored could see him. The Prophet said,</p><p>«وَرَجُلٌ ذَكَرَ اللهَ تَعَالَى خَالِيًا، فَفَاضَتْ عَيْنَاه»</p><p>(And a man who remembered Allah the Exalted while alone, and his eyes became tearful.) Allah said,</p><p>وَجَآءَ بِقَلْبٍ مُّنِيبٍ</p><p>(and brought a heart turned in repentance. ) meaning, he will meet Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored, on the Day of Resurrection with a heart turned in repentance to Him and absolutely free (of Shirk) and humbled to Him,</p><p>ادْخُلُوهَا</p><p>(Enter you therein), meaning Paradise,</p><p>بِسَلَـمٍ</p><p>(in peace and security), they will earn security from the torment of Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored, and the angels of Allah will greet them with the Salam, according to the explanation of Qatadah. The statement of Allah the Exalted and Most Honored:</p><p>ذَلِكَ يَوْمُ الُخُلُودِ</p><p>(-- this is a Day of eternal life!), meaning, they will reside in Paradise forever and will never die, neither be transferred from it nor wish to be transferred from it. The statement of Allah the All-Mighty,</p><p>لَهُم مَّا يَشَآءُونَ فِيهَا</p><p>(There they will have all that they desire), means, whatever delights they wish and desire, they will find it brought before them. Allah's statement,</p><p>وَلَدَيْنَا مَزِيدٌ</p><p>(and We have more.) is similar to His other statement,</p><p>لِّلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُواْ الْحُسْنَى وَزِيَادَةٌ</p><p>(For those who have done good is the best and even more. )(10:26) In the Sahih, Muslim recorded that Suhayb bin Sinan Ar-Rumi said that `more' refers to looking at the Most Honorable Face of Allah.</p>"
