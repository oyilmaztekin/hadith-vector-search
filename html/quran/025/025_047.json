    "text": "<h2>Evidence of the existence of the Creator and the extent of His Power</h2><p>Here Allah begins explaining the evidence for His existence and His perfect power to create various things and pairs of opposites. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى رَبِّكَ كَيْفَ مَدَّ الظِّلَّ</div><p>(Have you not seen how your Lord spread the shadow.) Ibn `Abbas, Ibn `Umar, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Abu Malik, Masruq, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, An-Nakha`i, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi and others said, \"This refers to the period from the beginning of the dawn until the sun rises.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ شَآءَ لَجَعَلَهُ سَاكِناً</div><p>(If He willed, He could have made it still) meaning, immobile, never changing. This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ أَرَأَيْتُمْ إِن جَعَلَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْكُمُ الَّيْلَ سَرْمَداً</div><p>(Say : \"Tell me! If Allah made the night continuous for you...\") (28:71)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ جَعَلْنَا الشَّمْسَ عَلَيْهِ دَلِيلاً</div><p>(but We have made the sun its guide.) means, were it not for the sun rising, it would not be there, for a thing can only be known in contrast to its opposite. Qatadah and As-Suddi said, \"The sun is a guide which follows the shade until the shade disappears. \"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ قَبَضْنَـهُ إِلَيْنَا قَبْضاً يَسِيراً </div><p>(Then We withdraw it towards Ourselves -- a gradual withdrawal.) This refers to the shade.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَسِيراً</div><p>(gradual) meaning slowly. As-Suddi said: \"A gentle, concealed, withdrawal until there is no shade left on earth except under a roof or a tree, and the sun is shining on whatever is above it.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَبْضاً يَسِيراً</div><p>(a gradual withdrawal.) Ayyub bin Musa said: \"Little by little.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الَّيْلَ لِبَاساً</div><p>(And it is He Who makes the night a covering for you,) It covers and conceals all things. This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّيْلِ إِذَا يَغْشَى </div><p>(By the night as it envelops) (92:1).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالنَّوْمَ سُبَاتاً</div><p>(and the sleep a repose,) means, a halt to movement so that bodies may rest. For the faculties and limbs get tired from their constant movement during the day when one goes out to earn a living. When night comes, and it becomes quiet, they stop moving, and rest; so sleep provides a rejuvenation for both the body and the soul.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلَ النَّهَارَ نُشُوراً</div><p>(and makes the day Nushur) meaning, people get up and go out to earn a living and attend to their business. This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِن رَّحْمَتِهِ جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَارَ لِتَسْكُنُواْ فِيهِ وَلِتَبتَغُواْ مِن فَضْلِهِ</div><p>(It is out of His mercy that He has made for you the night and the day that you may rest therein and that you may seek of His bounty...) (28:73)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ الَّذِى أَرْسَلَ الرِّيَـحَ بُشْرَى بَيْنَ يَدَىْ رَحْمَتِهِ وَأَنزَلْنَا مِنَ السَّمَآءِ مَآءً طَهُوراً </div>"
