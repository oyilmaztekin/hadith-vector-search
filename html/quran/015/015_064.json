    "text": "<h2>The Angels coming to Lut</h2><p>Allah tells us about when the angels came to Lut in the form of young men with handsome faces. When they entered his home, he said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ إِنَّكُمْ قَوْمٌ مُّنكَرُونَ - قَالُواْ بَلْ جِئْنَـكَ بِمَا كَانُواْ فِيهِ يَمْتَرُونَ </div><p>(\"Verily, you are people unknown to me.\" They said: \"Nay, we have come to you with that (torment) which they have been doubting.\") meaning that they were bringing the punishment and destruction that the people doubted they would ever suffer from.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَآتَيْنَـكَ بِالْحَقِّ</div><p>(And we have brought you the truth) is like the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا نُنَزِّلُ الْمَلَـئِكَةَ إِلاَّ بِالحَقِّ</div><p>(We do not send the angels down except with the truth) 15:8 and</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وِإِنَّا لَصَـدِقُونَ</div><p>(and certainly, we tell the truth.) They said this in affirmation of the news that they brought him, that he would be saved and his people would be destroyed.</p>"
