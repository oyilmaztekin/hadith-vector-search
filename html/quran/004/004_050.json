    "text": "<h2>Chastising and Cursing the Jews for Claiming Purity for Themselves and Believing in Jibt and Taghut</h2><p>Al-Hasan and Qatadah said, \"This Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ يُزَكُّونَ أَنفُسَهُمْ</div><p>(Have you not seen those who claim sanctity for themselves) was revealed about the Jews and Christians when they said, `We are Allah's children and His loved ones.\"' Ibn Zayd also said, \"This Ayah was revealed concerning their statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">نَحْنُ أَبْنَاءُ اللَّهِ وَأَحِبَّاؤُهُ</div><p>(We are the children of Allah and His loved ones) and their statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَن يَدْخُلَ الْجَنَّةَ إِلاَّ مَن كَانَ هُودًا أَوْ نَصَـرَى</div><p>(None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian).\" This is why Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلِ اللَّهُ يُزَكِّى مَن يَشَآءُ</div><p>(Nay, but Allah sanctifies whom He wills,) meaning, the decision in this matter is with Allah Alone, because He has perfect knowledge of the true reality and secrets of all things. Allah then said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يُظْلَمُونَ فَتِيلاً</div><p>(And they will not be dealt with injustice even equal to the extent of a Fatil, ) meaning, He does no injustice with anyone's compensation in any part of his reward, even if it was the weight of a Fatil. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, `Ata', Al-Hasan, Qatadah and others among the Salaf said that Fatil means, \"The scalish thread in the long slit of the date-stone.\" Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">انظُرْ كَيفَ يَفْتَرُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ الكَذِبَ</div><p>(Look, how they invent a lie against Allah,) claiming purity for themselves, their claim that they are Allah's children and His loved ones, their statement;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَن يَدْخُلَ الْجَنَّةَ إِلاَّ مَن كَانَ هُودًا أَوْ نَصَـرَى</div><p>(None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian) their statement;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَن تَمَسَّنَا النَّارُ إِلاَ أَيَّامًا مَّعْدُودَتٍ</div><p>(The Fire shall not touch us but for a number of days) and their reliance on the righteous deeds of their forefathers. Allah has decreed that the good actions of the fathers do not help the children, when He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تِلْكَ أُمَّةٌ قَدْ خَلَتْ لَهَا مَا كَسَبَتْ وَلَكُم مَّا كَسَبْتُم</div><p>(That was a nation who has passed away. They shall receive the reward of what they earned and you of what you earn). Allah then said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَفَى بِهِ إِثْماً مُّبِيناً</div><p>(and enough is that as a manifest sin. ) meaning, these lies and fabrications of theirs are sufficent. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ نَصِيباً مِّنَ الْكِتَـبِ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِالْجِبْتِ وَالطَّـغُوتِ</div><p>(Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Scripture They believe in Jibt and Taghut). Muhammad bin Ishaq said from Hassan bin Fa'id that `Umar bin Al-Khattab said, \"Jibt is sorcery and Taghut is the Shaytan.\" Abu Nasr Isma`il bin Hammad Al-Jawhari, the renowned scholar, said in his book As-Sihah, \"Al-Jibt means idol, soothsayer and sorcerer.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Jabir bin `Abdullah was asked about Taghut, and he said, \"They are soothsayers upon whom the devils descend.\" Mujahid said \"Taghut is a devil in the shape of man, and they refer to him for judgment.\" Imam Malik said, \"Taghut is every object that is worshipped instead of Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored.\"</p><h2>Disbelievers Are not Better Guided Than Believers</h2><p>Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَقُولُونَ لِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ هَـؤُلاءِ أَهْدَى مِنَ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ سَبِيلاً</div><p>(and say to those who disbelieve, \"These people are better guided on the way,\" than the believers.) preferring the disbelievers over Muslims, because of their ignorance, un-religious nature and disbelief in Allah's Book which is before them. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Ikrimah said, \"Huyay bin Akhtab and Ka`b bin Al-Ashraf (two Jewish leaders) came to the people of Makkah, who said to them, `You (Jews) are people of the Book and knowledge, so judge us and Muhammad.' They said, `Describe yourselves and describe Muhammad.' They said, `We keep relation with kith and kin, slaughter camels (for the poor), release the indebted and provide water for the pilgrims. As for Muhammad he is without male children, he severed our relations, and the thieves who rob pilgrims (the tribe of) Ghifar follow him. So who is better, we or him' They said, `You are more righteous and better guided.' Thereafter, Allah sent down,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ نَصِيبًا</div><p>(Have you not seen those who were given a portion).\" This story was also reported from Ibn `Abbas and several others among the Salaf. Allah's Curse on the Jews This Ayah 4:52 contains a curse for the Jews and informs them that they have no supporter in this life or the Hereafter, because they sought the help of the idolators. They uttered this statement in Ayah 4:51 to lure the disbelievers into supporting them, and they ultimately gathered their forces for the battle of Al-Ahzab, forcing the Prophet and his Companions to dig a defensive tunnel around Al-Madinah. But, Allah saved the Muslims from their evil,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرَدَّ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِغَيْظِهِمْ لَمْ يَنَالُواْ خَيْراً وَكَفَى اللَّهُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ الْقِتَالَ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ قَوِيّاً عَزِيزاً </div><p>(And Allah drove back those who disbelieved in their rage, they gained no advantage (booty). Allah sufficed for the believers in the fighting. And Allah is Ever All-Strong, All-Mighty).</p>"
