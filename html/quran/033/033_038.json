Allah would not command them to do anything for which they might be blamed. This is a refutation of those hypocrites who imagined that there was anything wrong with his marrying the ex-wife of Zayd, his freed slave and adopted son.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَانَ أَمْرُ اللَّهِ قَدَراً مَّقْدُوراً</div><p>(And the command of Allah is a decree determined.) means, His command which He has decreed must inevitably come to pass; nothing can prevent it or avert it, for whatever He wills happens, and whatever He does not decree, does not happen.</p>"
