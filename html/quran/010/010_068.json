    "text": "<h2>Allah is Far Above taking a Wife or having Children</h2><p>Allah criticizes those who claim that He has, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَداً سُبْحَـنَهُ هُوَ الْغَنِيُّ</div><p>(...begotten a son. Glory is to Him! He is Rich (Free of all needs).) He is Greater than that and above it. He is Self-Sufficient, free of want or need of anything. Everything else is in desperate need of Him, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَهُ مَا فِى السَّمَـوَت وَمَا فِى الاٌّرْضِ</div><p>(His is all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth.) So how can He have a son from what He has created Everything and everyone belongs to Him and is His servant. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنْ عِندَكُمْ مِّن سُلْطَانٍ بِهَـذَآ</div><p>(No warrant have you for this) Meaning, you have no proof for the lies and falsehood that you claim, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَتَقُولُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ مَا لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(Do you say against Allah what you know not.) This is a severe threat and a firm warning. Similarly, Allah threatened and said: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَلَداً - لَقَدْ جِئْتُمْ شَيْئاً إِدّاً - تَكَادُ السَّمَـوَتُ يَتَفَطَّرْنَ مِنْهُ وَتَنشَقُّ الاٌّرْضُ وَتَخِرُّ الْجِبَالُ هَدّاً - أَن دَعَوْا لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَداً - وَمَا يَنبَغِى لِلرَّحْمَـنِ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَداً - إِن كُلُّ مَن فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ إِلاَّ آتِى الرَّحْمَـنِ عَبْداً - لَّقَدْ أَحْصَـهُمْ وَعَدَّهُمْ عَدّاً - وَكُلُّهُمْ ءَاتِيهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ فَرْداً </div><p>(And they say: \"The Most Gracious has begotten a son.\" Indeed you have brought forth a terribly evil thing. Whereby the heavens are almost torn, and the earth is split asunder, and the mountains fall in ruins, that they ascribe a son to the Most Gracious. But it is not suitable for the Most Gracious that He should beget a son. There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto the Most Gracious as a servant. Verily, He knows each one of them, and has counted them a full counting. And everyone of them will come to Him alone on the Day of Resurrection.) (19:88-95) Then Allah warned the liars that fabricated the claim that He has begotten a son. He warned that they will not succeed, never prospering in this world or in the Hereafter. In this world Allah will lead them, step-by-step, to their ruin. He will give them respite and put up with them for a while. He will allow them to have little enjoyment, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ نَضْطَرُّهُمْ إِلَى عَذَابٍ غَلِيظٍ</div><p>(then in the end We shall oblige them to (enter) a great torment.)(31:24) As Allah said here: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَتَـعٌ فِى الدُّنْيَا</div><p>((A brief) enjoyment in this world!) meaning, only a short period, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ إِلَيْنَا مَرْجِعُهُمْ</div><p>(and then unto Us will be their return) on the Day of Resurrection; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ نُذِيقُهُمُ الْعَذَابَ الشَّدِيدَ بِمَا كَانُواْ يَكْفُرُونَ</div><p>(Then We shall make them taste the severest torment because they used to disbelieve. ) meaning, `We shall make them taste the painful punishment because of their Kufr and lies about Allah.' </p>"
