https://quran.com/2:240/tafsirs/en-tafisr-ibn-kathir

2:240 represents the surah and the ayah number. 

there are 114 ayah in quran so we will count from 1-114 for ayah number

go in 1 surah
start count with 1 and increase the number until you recieve 404. if you reach 404 try again and make sure it is not occur for problem. then move with the next surah. it means the last ayah is ended.

for example: 
- 1:7 last ayah of first surah(Fatihah), 
- 1:8 returns 404
- skip the surah then go with 2:1
