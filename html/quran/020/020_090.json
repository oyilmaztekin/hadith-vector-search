He told them that their Lord was the Most Beneficent, Who created everything and decreed for everything its just measure. He is the Owner of the Mighty Throne, the One Who does whatever He wants. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاتَّبِعُونِى وَأَطِيعُواْ أَمْرِى</div><p>(so follow me and obey my order.) Meaning, \"Follow me in that which I am commanding you with and leave that which I forbid you from.\" </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالُواْ لَن نَّبْرَحَ عَلَيْهِ عَـكِفِينَ حَتَّى يَرْجِعَ إِلَيْنَا مُوسَى </div><p>(They said: \"We will not stop worshipping it, until Musa returns to us.\") meaning, \"We will not cease in our worship of this calf until we hear what Musa has to say about it.\" So they opposed Harun in this matter and they fought against him, nearly killing him. </p>"
