    "text": "<h2>Allah Alone is the One Who has the Power of Creation, Knowledge and Choice</h2><p>Allah tells us that He is the only One Who has the power to create and make decisions, and there is no one who can dispute with Him in that or reverse His judgement. His saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرَبُّكَ يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ وَيَخْتَارُ</div><p>(And your Lord creates whatsoever He wills and chooses,) means, whatever He wills, for what He wills, happens; and what He does not will, does not happen. All things, good and bad alike, are in His Hands and will return to Him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا كَانَ لَهُمُ الْخِيَرَةُ</div><p>(no choice have they.) is a negation, according to the correct view. This is like the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كَانَ لِمُؤْمِنٍ وَلاَ مُؤْمِنَةٍ إِذَا قَضَى اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ أَمْراً أَن يَكُونَ لَهُمُ الْخِيَرَةُ مِنْ أَمْرِهِمْ</div><p>(It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any option in their decision) (33:36). Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرَبُّكَ يَعْلَمُ مَا تُكِنُّ صُدُورُهُمْ وَمَا يُعْلِنُونَ </div><p>(And your Lord knows what their breasts conceal, and what they reveal.) He knows what is hidden in their hearts, just as He knows what they do openly.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَوَآءٌ مِّنْكُمْ مَّنْ أَسَرَّ الْقَوْلَ وَمَنْ جَهَرَ بِهِ وَمَنْ هُوَ مُسْتَخْفٍ بِالَّيْلِ وَسَارِبٌ بِالنَّهَارِ </div><p>(It is the same whether any of you conceals his speech or declares it openly, whether he be hid by night or goes forth freely by day.) (13:10).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ اللَّهُ لا إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ</div><p>(And He is Allah; La ilaha illa Huwa,) meaning, He is unique in His divinity, for none is to be worshipped besides Him, and there is no lord who can create what he wills and chooses besides Him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَهُ الْحَمْدُ فِى الاٍّولَى وَالاٌّخِرَةِ</div><p>(His is the praise, in the first and in the last,) in all that He does, He is to be praised for His justice and wisdom.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَهُ الْحُكْمُ</div><p>(His is the decision,) that none can put back, because of His might, power, wisdom and mercy.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِلَيْهِ تُرْجَعُونَ</div><p>(and to Him shall you be returned.) means, all of you on the Day of Resurrection, and everyone will be rewarded or punished according to his deeds, good and evil alike, and absolutely none of their deeds will be concealed from Him.</p>"
