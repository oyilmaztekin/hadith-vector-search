    "text": "<h2>Which was revealed in Makkah</h2><h2>Reciting Surat Al-A`la and Al-Ghashiyah in the Friday Prayer</h2><p>It has already been mentioned on the authority of An-Nu`man bin Bashir that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to recite Surat Al-A`la (87) and Al-Ghashiyah in the `Id and Friday prayers. Imam Malik recorded that Ad-Dahhak bin Qays asked An-Nu`man bin Bashir, \"What else did the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recite on Friday along with Surat Al-Jumu`ah\" An-Nu`man replied, \"Al-Ghashiyah (88).\" This narration has been recorded by Abu Dawud, An-Nasa'i, Muslim and Ibn Majah.</p><p>بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ</p><p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p><h2>The Day of Judgement and what will happen to the People of the Fire during it Al-Ghashiyah is one of</h2><p>This was said by Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah and Ibn Zayd. It has been called this because it will overwhelm the people and overcome them. Allah then says,</p><p>وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ خَـشِعَةٌ</p><p>(Some faces that Day will be Khashi`ah.) meaning, humiliated. This was said by Qatadah. Ibn `Abbas said, \"They will be humble but this action will be of no benefit to them.\" Then Allah says,</p><p>عَامِلَةٌ نَّاصِبَةٌ</p><p>(Laboring, weary.) meaning, they did many deeds and became weary in their performance, yet they will be cast into a blazing Fire on the Day of Judgement. Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Al-Burqani narrated from Abu `Imran Al-Jawni that he said, \" `Umar bin Al-Khattab passed by the monastery of a monk and he said: `O monk!' Then the monk came out, and `Umar looked at him and began to weep. Then it was said to him: `O Commander of the faithful! Why are you weeping' He replied: `I remembered the statement of Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, in His Book,</p><p>عَامِلَةٌ نَّاصِبَةٌ - تَصْلَى نَاراً حَامِيَةً</p><p>(Laboring, weary. They will enter into Fire, Hamiyah.) So that is what has made me cry. \"' Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said,</p><p>عَامِلَةٌ نَّاصِبَةٌ</p><p>(Laboring, weary.) \"The Christians.\" It is narrated that `Ikrimah and As-Suddi both said, \"Laboring in the worldly life with disobedience, and weariness in the Fire from torment and perdition.\" Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan, and Qatadah all said,</p><p>تَصْلَى نَاراً حَامِيَةً</p><p>(They will enter into Fire, Hamiyah) meaning, hot with intense heat.</p><p>تُسْقَى مِنْ عَيْنٍ ءَانِيَةٍ</p><p>(They will be given to drink from a boiling (Aniyah) spring.) meaning, its heat has reached its maximum limit and boiling point. This was said by Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Al-Hasan and As-Suddi. Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>لَّيْسَ لَهُمْ طَعَامٌ إِلاَّ مِن ضَرِيعٍ</p><p>(No food will there be for them but from Dari`,) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, \"A tree from the Hellfire.\" Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Abu Al-Jawza' and Qatadah, all said, \"It is Ash-Shibriq (a type of plant).\" Qatadah said, \"The Quraysh called it Ash-Shabraq in the spring and Ad-Dari` in the summer.\" `Ikrimah said, \"It is a thorny tree which reaches down to the ground.\" Al-Bukhari related that Mujahid said, \"Ad-Dari` is a plant that is called Ash-Shibriq. The people of the Hijaz call it Ad-Dari` when it dries, and it is poisonous.\" Ma`mar narrated that Qatadah said,</p><p>لَّيْسَ لَهُمْ طَعَامٌ إِلاَّ مِن ضَرِيعٍ</p><p>(No food will there be for them but from Dari`,) \"This is Ash-Shibriq. When it dries it is called Ad-Dari`.\" Sa`id narrated from Qatadah that he said,</p><p>لَّيْسَ لَهُمْ طَعَامٌ إِلاَّ مِن ضَرِيعٍ</p><p>(No food will there be for them but Dari`,) \"This is of the worst, most disgusting and loathsome of foods.\" Concerning Allah's statement,</p><p>لاَّ يُسْمِنُ وَلاَ يُغْنِى مِن جُوعٍ</p><p>(Which will neither nourish nor avail against hunger.) This means that the intent in eating it will not be achieved, and nothing harmful will be repelled by it.</p>"
