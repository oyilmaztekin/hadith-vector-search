    "text": "<h2>The Descent of Adam to the Earth and the Promise of Good for the Guided and Evil for the Transgressors</h2><p>Allah says to Adam, Hawwa' and Iblis, \"Get down from here, all of you.\" This means each of you should get out of Paradise. We expounded upon this in Surah Al-Baqarah. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَعْضُكُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ</div><p>(Some of you as enemies to others.) 2:36 He (Allah) was saying this to Adam and his progeny and Iblis and his progeny. Concerning Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِمَّا يَأْتِيَنَّكُم مِّنِّى هُدًى</div><p>(Then if there comes to you guidance from Me,) Abu Al-`Aliyyah said, \"This (guidance) means the Prophets, the Messengers and the evidence.\" </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَمَنِ اتَّبَعَ هُدَاىَ فَلاَ يَضِلُّ وَلاَ يَشْقَى</div><p>(Then whoever follows My guidance he shall neither go astray nor shall be distressed.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"He will not be misguided in this life and he will not be distressed in the Hereafter.\" </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَنْ أَعْرَضَ عَن ذِكْرِى</div><p>(But whosoever turns away from My Reminder,) This means, \"Whoever opposes my command and what I have revealed to My Messenger, then he has turned away from it, neglected it and taken his guidance from other than it.\" </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِنَّ لَهُ مَعِيشَةً ضَنكاً</div><p>(verily, for him is a life of hardship,) meaning, his life will be hard in this world. He will have no tranquillity and no expanding of his breast (ease). Rather, his chest will be constrained and in difficulty due to his misguidance. Even if he appears to be in comfort outwardly and he wears whatever he likes, eats whatever he likes and lives wherever he wants, he will not be happy. For verily, his heart will not have pure certainty and guidance. He will be in agitation, bewilderment and doubt. He will always be in confusion and a state of uncertainty. This is from the hardship of life. Concerning His statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنَحْشُرُهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيـمَةِ أَعْمَى</div><p>(and We shall raise him up blind on the Day of Resurrection.) Mujahid, Abu Salih and As-Suddi said, \"This means he will have no proof.\" `Ikrimah said, \"He will be made blind to everything except Hell.\" This is as Allah says, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنَحْشُرُهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ عُمْيًا وَبُكْمًا وَصُمًّا مَّأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ</div><p>(And We shall gather them together on the Day of Resurrection on their faces, blind, dumb and deaf; their abode will be Hell.) 17:97 This is why Allah says, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبِّ لِمَ حَشَرْتَنِى أَعْمَى وَقَدْ كُنتُ بَصِيراً</div><p>(O my Lord! Why have you raised me up blind, while I had sight (before).) This means in the life of this world. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ كَذَلِكَ أَتَتْكَ آيَـتُنَا فَنَسِيتَهَا وَكَذلِكَ الْيَوْمَ تُنْسَى </div><p>((Allah) will say: \"Like this Our Ayat came unto you, but you disregarded them, and so this Day, you will be neglected.) Meaning, \"When you turned away from the signs of Allah and dealt with them in the manner of one who does not remember them after they were conveyed to you. You neglected them, turned away from them and were heedless of them. Therefore, today We will treat you in the manner of one who has forgotten you.\" </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَالْيَوْمَ نَنسَـهُمْ كَمَا نَسُواْ لِقَآءَ يَوْمِهِمْ هَـذَا</div><p>(So this Day We shall forget them as they forgot their meeting of this Day.) 7:51 For verily, the punishment will be a retribution that is based upon the type of deed that was done. However, forgetting the words of the Qur'an, while understanding its meaning and acting upon its legislation, is not included in the meaning of this specific threat. Yet, forgetting the words of the Qur'an has been warned against from a different aspect. It has been reported in the Sunnah that it is absolutely forbidden and there is a serious threat against one who forgets Qur'an (that he previously memorized). </p>"
