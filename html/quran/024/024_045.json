Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَخْلُقُ اللَّهُ مَا يَشَآءُ</div><p>(Allah creates what He wills.) meaning by His power, because what He wills happens and what He does not will does not happen. So he says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</div><p>(Verily, Allah is able to do all things.)</p>"
