So he says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِيُرِيَكُمْ مِّنْ ءَايَـتِهِ</div><p>(that He may show you of His signs) meaning, by His power.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ فِى ذلِكَ لآيَـتٍ لِّكُلِّ صَبَّارٍ شَكُورٍ</div><p>(Verily, in this are signs for every patient, grateful.) means, every person who bears difficulty with patience and who gives thanks at times of ease. Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا غَشِيَهُمْ مَّوْجٌ كَالظُّلَلِ</div><p>(And when waves cover them like shades,) meaning, like mountains or clouds,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">دَعَوُاْ اللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ الدِّينَ</div><p>(they invoke Allah, making their invocations for Him only.) This is like the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا مَسَّكُمُ الْضُّرُّ فِى الْبَحْرِ ضَلَّ مَن تَدْعُونَ إِلاَ إِيَّاهُ</div><p>(And when harm touches you upon the sea, those that you call upon vanish from you except Him) (17:67).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِذَا رَكِبُواْ فِى الْفُلْكِ</div><p>(And when they embark on a ship...) (29:65) Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّا نَجَّـهُمْ إِلَى الْبَرِّ فَمِنْهُمْ مُّقْتَصِدٌ</div><p>(But when He brings them safe to land, there are among them those that stop in between.) Mujahid said, \"This refers to the disbelievers -- as if he interpreted the word Muqtasid to mean denier as in the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلَمَّا نَجَّاهُمْ إِلَى الْبَرِّ إِذَا هُمْ يُشْرِكُونَ</div><p>(but when He brings them safely to land, behold, they give a share of their worship to others) (29:65).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا يَجْحَدُ بِـَايَـتِنَآ إِلاَّ كُلُّ خَتَّارٍ كَفُورٍ</div><p>(And Our Ayat are not denied except by every Khattar Kafur.) Khattar means one who betrays or stabs in the back. This was the view of Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and Malik, narrating from Zayd bin Aslam. This word describes a person who, whenever he makes a promise, breaks his promise, and it refers to the worst form of treachery.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَفُورٌ</div><p>(Kafur) means, one who denies blessings and does not give thanks for them, rather he forgets them and does not remember them.</p>"
