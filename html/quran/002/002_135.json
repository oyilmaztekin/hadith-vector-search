Therefore, follow us, O Muhammad, and you will be rightly guided.\" Also, the Christians said similarly, so Allah revealed,</p><p>وَقَالُواْ كُونُواْ هُودًا أَوْ نَصَـرَى تَهْتَدُواْ</p><p>(And they say, \"Be Jews or Christians, then you will be guided.\") Allah's statement,</p><p>قُلْ بَلْ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَهِيمَ حَنِيفًا</p><p>(Say (to them O Muhammad ), \"Nay, (we follow) only the religion of Ibrahim, Hanif) means, \"We do not need the Judaism or Christianity that you call us to, rather,</p><p>مِلَّةَ إِبْرَهِيمَ حَنِيفاً</p><p>((we follow) only the religion of Ibrahim, Hanif) meaning, on the straight path, as Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi and `Isa bin Jariyah stated. Also, Abu Qilabah said, \"The Hanif is what the Messengers, from beginning to end, believed in.\")</p>"
