    "text": "<h2>Ya`qub's Will and Testament to His Children upon His Death</h2><p>This Ayah contains Allah's criticism of the Arab pagans among the offspring of Isma`il as well as the disbelievers among the Children of Israel Jacob the son of Isaac, the son of Ibrahim. When death came to Jacob, he advised his children to worship Allah alone without partners. He said to them, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن بَعْدِى قَالُواْ نَعْبُدُ إِلَـهَكَ وَإِلَـهَ آبَآئِكَ إِبْرَهِيمَ وَإِسْمَـعِيلَ وَإِسْحَـقَ</div><p>(\"What will you worship after me\" They said, \"We shall worship your Ilah (God ـ Allah) the Ilah of your fathers, Ibrahim, Isma`il, Ishaq,\") </p><p>Mentioning Isma`il here is a figure of speech, because Isma`il is Jacob's uncle. An-Nahas said that the Arabs call the uncle a father, as Al-Qurtubi mentioned). </p><p>This Ayah is used as evidence that the grandfather is called a father and inherits, rather than the brothers (i.e. when his son dies), as Abu Bakr asserted, according to Al-Bukhari who narrated Abu Bakr's statement from Ibn `Abbas and Ibn Az-Zubayr. Al-Bukhari then commented that there are no opposing opinions regarding this subject. This is also the opinion of `A'ishah the Mother of the believers, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Tawus and `Ata', Malik, Ash-Shaf`i and Ahmad said that the inheritance is divided between the grandfather and the brothers. It was reported that this was also the opinion of `Umar, `Uthman, `Ali, bin Mas`ud, Zayd bin Thabit and several scholars among the Salaf and later generations. </p><p>The statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلَـهًا وَاحِدًا</div><p>(One Ilah (God)) means, \"We single Him out in divinity and do not associate anything or anyone with Him.\" </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنَحْنُ لَهُ مُسْلِمُونَ</div><p>(And to Him we submit), in obedience meaning, obedient and submissiveness. Similarly, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَهُ أَسْلَمَ مَن فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ طَوْعًا وَكَرْهًا وَإِلَيْهِ يُرْجَعُونَ</div><p>(While to Him submitted all creatures in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly. And to Him shall they all be returned) (3:83). </p><p>Indeed, Islam is the religion of all the Prophets, even if their reispective laws differed. Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ نُوحِى إِلَيْهِ أَنَّهُ لا إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ أَنَاْ فَاعْبُدُونِ </div><p>(And We did not send any Messenger before you (O Muhammad ) but We revealed to him (saying): La ilaha illa Ana none has the right to be worshipped but I (Allah), so worship Me (alone and none else)) (21:25). </p><p>There are many other Ayat - and Hadiths - on this subject. For instance, the Prophet said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«نَحْنُ مَعْشَرَ الْأَنْبِيَاءِ أَوْلَادُ عَلَّاتٍ دِينُنا وَاحِد»</div><p>(We, the Prophets, are brothers with different mothers, but the same religion.) </p><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تِلْكَ أُمَّةٌ قَدْ خَلَتْ</div><p>(That was a nation who has passed away) meaning, existed before your time, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَهَا مَا كَسَبَتْ وَلَكُم مَّا كَسَبْتُم</div><p>(They shall receive the reward of what they earned and you of what you earn). </p><p>This Ayah proclaims, Your relationship to the Prophets or righteous people among your ancestors will not benefit you, unless you perform good deeds that bring about you religious benefit. They have their deeds and you have yours, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تُسْـَلُونَ عَمَّا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ</div><p>(And you will not be asked of what they used to do).\" </p><p>This is why a Hadith proclaims, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«مَنْ بَطَّأَ بِهِ عَمَلُهُ لَمْ يُسْرِعْ بِهِ نَسَبُه»</div><p>(Whoever was slowed on account of his deeds will not get any faster on account of his family lineage.)' </p>"
