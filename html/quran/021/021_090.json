    "text": "<h2>Zakariyya and Yahya</h2><p>Allah tells us of His servant Zakariyya, who asked Allah to grant him a son who would be a Prophet after him. The story has already been given in detail at the beginning of Surah Maryam and also in Surah `Imran. Here an abbreviated version is given.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِذْ نَادَى رَبَّهُ</div><p>(when he cried to his Lord) means, in secret, hiding it from his people.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبِّ لاَ تَذَرْنِى فَرْداً</div><p>(O My Lord! Leave me not single,) means, with no child and no heir to stand among the people after me.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنتَ خَيْرُ الْوَرِثِينَ</div><p>(though You are the Best of the inheritors.) This is a supplication and form of praise befitting the topic. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاسْتَجَبْنَا لَهُ وَوَهَبْنَا لَهُ يَحْيَى وَأَصْلَحْنَا لَهُ زَوْجَهُ</div><p>(So We answered his call, and We bestowed upon him Yahya, and cured his wife for him.) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Sa`id bin Jubayr said: \"She was barren and never had a child, then she gave birth.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ يُسَارِعُونَ فِى الْخَيْرَتِ</div><p>(Verily, they used to hasten on to do good deeds,) means, acts of worship and acts of obedience towards Allah.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَدْعُونَنَا رَغَباً وَرَهَباً</div><p>(and they used to call on Us with hope and fear,) Ath-Thawri said, \"Hoping for that (reward) which is with Us and fearing that (punishment) which is with Us.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَانُواْ لَنَا خـشِعِينَ</div><p>(and they were Khashi`in before Us.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that this means, sincerely believing in that which was revealed by Allah. Mujahid said: \"Truly believing.\" Abu Al-`Aliyah said: \"Fearing.\" Abu Sinan said: \"Khushu` means the fear which should never leave our hearts.\" It was also reported from Mujahid that the Khashi`in are those who are humble.\" Al-Hasan, Qatadah and Ad-Dahhak said, \"The Khashi`in are those who humble themselves before Allah.\" All of these suggestions are close in meaning.</p>"
