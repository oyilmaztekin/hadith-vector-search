    "text": "<h2>The Stubbornness of the Jews regarding the Cow; Allah made the Matter difficult for Them</h2><p>Allah mentioned the stubbornness of the Children of Israel and the many unnecessary questions they asked their Messengers. This is why when they were stubborn, Allah made the decisions difficult for them. Had they slaughtered a cow, any cow, it would have been sufficient for them, as Ibn `Abbas and `Ubaydah have said. Instead, they made the matter difficult, and this is why Allah made it even more difficult for them. They said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ادْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ يُبَيِّنَ لَّنَا مَا هِىَ</div><p>(Call upon your Lord for us that He may make plain to us what it is!), meaning, \"What is this cow and what is its description\" Musa said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ يَقُولُ إِنَّهَا بَقَرَةٌ لاَّ فَارِضٌ وَلاَ بِكْرٌ</div><p>(He says, `Verily, it is a cow neither too old nor too young'), meaning, that it is neither old nor below the age of breeding. This is the opinion of Abu Al-`Aliyah, As-Suddi, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, `Atiyah Al-`Awfi, `Ata', Al-Khurasani, Wahb bin Munabbih, Ad-Dahhak, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and Ibn `Abbas. Ad-Dahhak reported that Ibn `Abbas said that, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَوَانٌ بَيْنَ ذلِكَ</div><p>(But (it is) between the two conditions) means, \"Neither old nor young. Rather, she was at the age when the cow is strongest and fittest.\" In his Tafsir Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas that, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاقِـعٌ لَّوْنُهَا</div><p>(bright in its colour) \"A deep yellowish white.\" </p><p>As-Suddi said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تَسُرُّ النَّـظِرِينَ</div><p>(pleasing the beholder) meaning, that it pleases those who see it. This is also the opinion of Abu Al-`Aliyah, Qatadah and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas. Furthermore, Wahb bin Munabbih said, \"If you look at the cow's skin, you will think that the sun's rays radiate through its skin.\" The modern version of the Tawrah mentions that the cow in the Ayah was red, but this is an error. Or, it might be that the cow was so yellow that it appeared blackish or reddish in color. Allah's knows best. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ البَقَرَ تَشَـبَهَ عَلَيْنَا</div><p>(Verily, to us all cows are alike) this means, that since cows are plentiful, then describe this cow for us further, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّآ إِن شَآءَ اللَّهُ</div><p>(And surely, if Allah wills) and if you further describe it to us, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَمُهْتَدُونَ</div><p>(we will be guided.) </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ إِنَّهُ يَقُولُ إِنَّهَا بَقَرَةٌ لاَّ ذَلُولٌ تُثِيرُ الاٌّرْضَ وَلاَ تَسْقِى الْحَرْثَ</div><p>(He says, `It is a cow neither trained to till the soil nor water the fields') meaning, it is not used in farming, or for watering purposes. Rather, it is honorable and fair looking. `Abdur-Razzaq said that Ma`mar said that Qatadah said that, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مُّسَلَّمَةٌ</div><p>(sound) means, \"The cow does not suffer from any defects.\" This is also the opinion of Abu Al-`Aliyah and Ar-Rabi`. Mujahid also said that the Ayah means the cow is free from defects. Further, `Ata' Al-Khurasani said that the Ayah means that its legs and body are free of physical defects. </p><p>Also, Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas said that the Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَذَبَحُوهَا وَمَا كَادُواْ يَفْعَلُونَ</div><p>(So they slaughtered it though they were near to not doing it) means, \"They did not want to slaughter it.\" </p><p>This means that even after all the questions and answers about the cow's description, the Jews were still reluctant to slaughter the cow. This part of the Qur'an criticized the Jews for their behavior, because their only goal was to be stubborn, and this is why they nearly did not slaughter the cow. Also, `Ubaydah, Mujahid, Wahb bin Munabbih, Abu Al-`Aliyah and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said, \"The Jews bought the cow with a large amount of money.\" There is a difference of opinion over this. </p>"
