    "text": "<h2>Only Human Messengers have been Sent</h2><p>Ad-Dahhak said, reporting from Ibn `Abbas: \"When Allah sent Muhammad as a Messenger, the Arabs, or some of them, denied him and said, `Allah is too great to send a human being as a Messenger.' Then Allah revealed:</p><p>أَكَانَ لِلنَّاسِ عَجَبًا أَنْ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَى رَجُلٍ مِّنْهُمْ أَنْ أَنذِرِ النَّاسَ</p><p>(Is it a wonder to people that We have sent Our Inspiration to a man from among themselves (saying): \"Warn mankind...\") and He said,</p><p>وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ إِلاَّ رِجَالاً نُّوحِى إِلَيْهِمْ فَاسْأَلُواْ أَهْلَ الذِّكْرِ إِن كُنْتُم لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ</p><p>(And We sent not (as Our Messengers) before you (O Muhammad) any but men, whom We sent Revelation. So ask Ahl Adh-Dhikr, if you know not.). meaning, (ask) the people of the previous Books, were the Messengers that were sent to them humans or angels If they were angels, then you have the right to find this strange, but if they were human, then you have no grounds to deny that Muhammad ﷺ is a Messenger. Allah says:</p><p>وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ إِلاَّ رِجَالاً نُّوحِى إِلَيْهِمْ مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْقُرَى</p><p>(And We sent not before you (as Messengers) any but men to whom We revealed, from among the people of townships. ) 12:109 and not from among the people of heaven as you say.\" It was reported by Mujahid from Ibn `Abbas that what is meant by Ahl Adh-Dhikr is the People of the Book. This is as Allah says:</p><p>أَوْ يَكُونَ لَكَ بَيْتٌ مِّن زُخْرُفٍ أَوْ تَرْقَى فِى السَّمَآءِ وَلَن نُّؤْمِنَ لِرُقِيِّكَ حَتَّى تُنَزِّلَ عَلَيْنَا كِتَابًا نَّقْرَءُهُ قُلْ سُبْحَـنَ رَبِّى هَلْ كُنتُ إَلاَّ بَشَرًا رَّسُولاً - وَمَا مَنَعَ النَّاسَ أَن يُؤْمِنُواْ إِذْ جَآءَهُمُ الْهُدَى إِلاَّ أَن قَالُواْ أَبَعَثَ اللَّهُ بَشَرًا رَّسُولاً</p><p>(Say: \"Glorified be my Lord! Am I anything but a man, sent as a Messenger\" And nothing prevented men from believing when the guidance came to them, except that they said: \"Has Allah sent a man as (His) Messenger\") (17:93-94)</p><p>وَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا قَبْلَكَ مِنَ الْمُرْسَلِينَ إِلاَّ إِنَّهُمْ لَيَأْكُلُونَ الطَّعَامَ وَيَمْشُونَ فِى الاٌّسْوَاقِ</p><p>(And We never sent before you (O Muhammad) any of the Messengers but verily, they ate food and walked in the markets.) (25:20)</p><p>وَمَا جَعَلْنَـهُمْ جَسَداً لاَّ يَأْكُلُونَ الطَّعَامَ وَمَا كَانُواْ خَـلِدِينَ</p><p>(And We did not create them (the Messengers, with) bodies that did not eat food, nor were they immortals.)(21:8)</p><p>قُلْ مَا كُنتُ بِدْعاً مِّنَ الرُّسُلِ</p><p>(Say (O Muhammad ): \"I am not a new thing among the Messengers. \") 46:9,</p><p>قُلْ إِنَّمَآ أَنَاْ بَشَرٌ مِّثْلُكُمْ يُوحَى إِلَىَّ</p><p>(Say (O Muhammad): \"I am only a man like you. It has been revealed to me.\") 18:110 Then Allah informs those who doubt that a Messenger can be a human to ask those who have knowledge of the previous Scriptures about the Prophets who came before: were their Prophets humans or angels Then Allah mentions that He has sent them,</p><p>بِالْبَيِّنَـتِ</p><p>(with clear signs), meaning proof and evidence, and</p><p>وَالزُّبُرِ</p><p>(and Books Zubur), meaning Scriptures. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak and others said: Zubur is the plural of Zabur, and the Arabs say, Zaburtul-Kitab meaning, \"I wrote the book.\" Allah says:</p><p>وَكُلُّ شَىْءٍ فَعَلُوهُ فِى الزُّبُرِ</p><p>(And everything they have done is noted in (their) Records (of deeds) Zubur) (54:52)</p><p>وَلَقَدْ كَتَبْنَا فِى الزَّبُورِ مِن بَعْدِ الذِّكْرِ أَنَّ الاٌّرْضَ يَرِثُهَا عِبَادِىَ الصَّـلِحُونَ</p><p>(And indeed We have written in Az-Zabur after the Dhikr that My righteous servant shall inherit the land (i.e. the land of Paradise).) (21:105) Then Allah says:</p><p>وَأَنزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ الذِّكْرَ</p><p>(And We have also revealed the Dhikr to you), meaning the Qur'an,</p><p>لِتُبَيِّنَ لِلنَّاسِ مَا نُزِّلَ إِلَيْهِمْ</p><p>(so that you may clearly explain to men what was revealed to them,) meaning, sent down from their Lord, because you know the meaning of what Allah has revealed to you, and because of your understanding and adherence to it, and because We know that you are the best of creation and the leader of the Children of Adam. So that you may explain in detail what has been mentioned in brief, and explain what is not clear.</p><p>وَلَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ</p><p>(so that perhaps they may reflect.) meaning, they should examine themselves and be guided by it, so that they may attain the victory of salvation in this world and the next.</p>"
