    "text": "<h2>The Resurrection will come suddenly, and Enmity will arise between close Friends among the Disbeliev</h2><p>Allah says, `do these idolaters who disbelieve in the Messengers wait'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ السَّاعَةَ أَن تَأْتِيَهُمْ بَغْتَةً وَهُمْ لاَ يَشْعُرُونَ</div><p>(only for the Hour that it shall come upon them suddenly while they perceive not) means, for it is real and will inevitably come to pass, and these negligent people are unprepared for it. When it comes, it will catch them unawares, and on that Day they will feel the utmost regret when regret will not benefit them in the slightest and will not afford them any protection.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الاٌّخِلاَءُ يَوْمَئِذٍ بَعْضُهُمْ لِبَعْضٍ عَدُوٌّ إِلاَّ الْمُتَّقِينَ </div><p>(Friends on that Day will be foes one to another except those who have Taqwa.) means, every friendship that exists for a purpose other than for the sake of Allah will turn to enmity on the Day of Resurrection, except for that which is for the sake of Allah, which will last forever. This is like the statement of Ibrahim, peace be upon him, to his people:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّمَا اتَّخَذْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ أَوْثَـناً مَّوَدَّةَ بَيْنِكُمْ فِى الْحَيَوةِ الدُّنْيَا ثُمَّ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ يَكْفُرُ بَعْضُكُمْ بِبَعْضٍ وَيَلْعَنُ بَعْضُكُمْ بَعْضاً وَمَأْوَاكُمُ النَّارُ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن نَّـصِرِينَ</div><p>(You have taken (for worship) idols instead of Allah. The love between you is only in the life of this world, but on the Day of Resurrection, you shall disown each other, and curse each other, and your abode will be the Fire, and you shall have no helper.) (29:25)</p><h2>Good News for Those with Taqwa on the Day of Resurrection, and Their entry into Paradise</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يعِبَادِ لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْكُمُوَلاَ أَنتُمْ تَحْزَنُونَ</div><p>(My servants! No fear shall be on you this Day, nor shall you grieve.) Then He will give them the glad tidings:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا وَكَانُواْ مُسْلِمِينَ </div><p>((You) who believed in Our Ayat and were Muslims.) means, their hearts believed and they submitted inwardly and outwardly to the Laws of Allah. Al-Mu`tamir bin Sulayman narrated that his father said: \"When the Day of Resurrection comes and the people are resurrected, there will be no one left who will not be filled with terror. Then a caller will cry out:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يعِبَادِ لاَ خَوْفٌ عَلَيْكُمُ الْيَوْمَ وَلاَ أَنتُمْ تَحْزَنُونَ </div><p>(My servants! No fear shall be on you this Day, nor shall you grieve.) So all the people will be filled with hope, but this will be followed by the words:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا وَكَانُواْ مُسْلِمِينَ </div><p>((You) who believed in Our Ayat and were Muslims.) Then all of mankind will be filled with despair apart from the believers.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ادْخُلُواْ الْجَنَّةَ</div><p>(Enter Paradise, ) means, they will be told to enter Paradise.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَنتُمْ وَأَزْوَجُكُمْ</div><p>(you and your wives,) means, your counterparts</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">تُحْبَرُونَ</div><p>(in happiness (Tuhbarun).) means, in delight and joy.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يُطَافُ عَلَيْهِمْ بِصِحَـفٍ مِّن ذَهَبٍ وَأَكْوَبٍ</div><p>(Trays of gold and cups will be passed round them;) means, fine vessels of gold containing food and drink, without spouts or handles. (وَفِيهَا مَا تَشْتَهِي الْأَنْفُسُ) (there will be) therein all that their souls could desire). Some of them recited:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا تَشْتَهِيهِ الاٌّنْفُسُ</div><p>(that their souls desire,)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتَلَذُّ الاٌّعْيُنُ</div><p>(and all that eyes could delight in) means, of good food, delightful fragrances and beautiful scenes.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنتُمْ فِيهَا</div><p>(and you will therein) means, in Paradise</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">خَـلِدُونَ</div><p>(abide forever) means, you will never leave it or want to exchange it. Then it will be said to them, as a reminder of the blessing and favor of Allah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَتِلْكَ الْجَنَّةُ الَّتِى أُورِثْتُمُوهَا بِمَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ </div><p>(This is the Paradise, which you have been made to inherit because of your deeds that you used to do.) means, the righteous deeds which were the cause of your being included in the mercy of Allah. For no one will be admitted to Paradise by virtue of their deeds alone; that will be by the mercy and grace of Allah. But the varying ranks and degrees of Paradise will be attained according to one's righteous deeds.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَكُمْ فِيهَا فَـكِهَةٌ كَثِيرَةٌ</div><p>(Therein for you will be fruits in plenty,) means, of all kinds.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِّنْهَا تَأْكُلُونَ</div><p>(of which you will eat.) means, whatever you choose and desire. When food and drink are mentioned, fruit is also mentioned to complete the picture of blessing and joy. And Allah knows best.</p>"
