    "text": "<h2>Preference of Allah to the Children of Israel and their dispute thereafter</h2><p>Allah the Exalted mentions the favors He granted the Children of Israel, such as revealing the Divine Books to them, sending the Messengers to them and granting them kingship. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَقَدْ ءَاتَيْنَا بَنِى إِسْرَءِيلَ الْكِتَـبَ وَالْحُكْمَ وَالنُّبُوَّةَ وَرَزَقْنَـهُمْ مِّنَ الطَّيِّبَـتِ</div><p>(And indeed We gave the Children of Israel the Scripture, and the understanding of the Scripture and its laws, and the prophethood; and provided them with good things,) such as foods and drinks,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَفَضَّلْنَـهُمْ عَلَى الْعَـلَمينَ</div><p>(and preferred them above the nations.) of their time,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَءاتَيْنَـهُم بَيِّنَـتٍ مِّنَ الاٌّمْرِ</div><p>(And gave them clear proofs in matters.) `We gave them evidences, proofs and unequivocal signs.' Therefore, the proof has been established against them, yet they differed among themselves after the proof came to them, out of transgression against each other,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ رَبَّكَ</div><p>(Verily, your Lord) `O Muhammad',</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَقْضِى بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ فِيمَا كَانُواْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ</div><p>(will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection about that wherein they used to differ. ) He will judge between them by His just judgement.</p><h2>Warning to this Ummah against following the Ways of the Children of Israel</h2><p>This Ayah contains a warning to the Muslim Ummah as well. It warns them not to take the path the Jews took nor adopt their ways. This is why Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ جَعَلْنَـكَ عَلَى شَرِيعَةٍ مِّنَ الاٌّمْرِ فَاتَّبِعْهَا</div><p>(Then We have put you on a (legal) way of commandment. So follow you that.) `follow what was revealed to you from your Lord, O Muhammad, there is no true deity except Him, and turn away from the idolators.' Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَتَّبِعْ أَهْوَآءَ الَّذِينَ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَإِنَّهُمْ لَن يُغْنُواْ عَنكَ مِنَ اللَّهِ شَيْئاً وَإِنَّ الظَّـلِمِينَ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلِيَآءُ بَعْضٍ</div><p>(and follow not the desires of those who know not. Verily, they can avail you nothing against Allah. Verily, the wrongdoers are protecting friends of one another,) Allah says, `what will the loyalty that the idolators give each other avail them' Indeed, all they will earn from their protecting friends is more loss, destruction and demise,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاللَّهُ وَلِىُّ الْمُتَّقِينَ</div><p>(but Allah is the Protector of those who have Taqwa.) and He will deliver them from the darkness to the light. In contrast, all the false deities are the protecting friends of those who disbelieve, taking them out of the light to the darkness. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَـذَا بَصَـئِرُ لِلنَّاسِ</div><p>(This is a clear insight and evidence for man- kind,) in reference to the Qur'an,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُدًى وَرَحْمَةً لِّقَوْمٍ يُوقِنُونَ</div><p>(and a guidance and a mercy for people who have faith with certainty.)</p>"
