Turn away from them and wait until,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَوْمَ يَدْعُو الدَّاعِ إِلَى شَىْءٍ نُّكُرٍ</div><p>(The Day that the caller will call (them) to a terrible thing.) to the Recompense and the afflictions, horrors and tremendous hardships that it brings forth,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">خُشَّعاً أَبْصَـرُهُمْ</div><p>(with humbled eyes), their eyes will be covered with disgrace,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَخْرُجُونَ مِنَ الاٌّجْدَاثِ كَأَنَّهُمْ جَرَادٌ مُّنتَشِرٌ</div><p>(they will come forth from (their) graves as if they were locusts spread abroad.) They will gather towards the area of Reckoning in such haste and crowds, in response to the caller, as if they were crowds of locusts spreading all about. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مُهْطِعِينَ</div><p>(Hastening) meaing hurriedly,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلَى الدَّاعِ</div><p>(towards the caller.) without being able to hesitate or slow down,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَقُولُ الْكَـفِرُونَ هَـذَا يَوْمٌ عَسِرٌ</div><p>(The disbelievers will say: \"This is a hard Day.\"), meaing, `this is a hard, terrible, horrifying and distressful Day,'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَذَلِكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ يَوْمٌ عَسِيرٌ - عَلَى الْكَـفِرِينَ غَيْرُ يَسِيرٍ </div><p>(Truly, that Day will be a Hard Day -- far from easy for the dis- believers.)
