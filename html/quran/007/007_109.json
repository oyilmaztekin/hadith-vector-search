    "text": "<h2>Fir`awn's People say that Musa is a Magician!</h2><p>The chiefs and noblemen of the people of Fir`awn agreed with Fir`awn's statement about Musa. After Fir`awn felt safe and returned to his throne, he said to the chiefs of his people, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ هَـذَا لَسَـحِرٌ عَلِيمٌ</div><p>(This is indeed a well-versed sorcerer) and they agreed. They held counsel to decide what they should do about Musa. They conspired to extinguish the light that he brought and bring down his word. They plotted to portray Musa as a liar and fake. They feared that he might lure people to his side by his magic, they claimed, and thus prevail over them and drive them away from their land. What they feared occured, just as Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنُرِىَ فِرْعَوْنَ وَهَـمَـنَ وَجُنُودَهُمَا مِنْهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يَحْذَرونَ</div><p>(And We let Fir`awn and Haman and their hosts receive from them that which they feared.) 28:6 After they conferred about Musa, they agreed on a plot, as Allah said about them, </p>"
