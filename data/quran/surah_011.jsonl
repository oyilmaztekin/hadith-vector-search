In another narration he said,\n«هُودٌ وَأَخَوَاتُهَا»\n(Surah Hud and its sisters...)\nبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nThe Qur'an and its Call to (worship) Allah Alone\nA discussion concerning the letters of the alphabet (which appear at the beginning of some chapters of the Qur'an) has already preceded at the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah.

Concerning Allah's statement,\nأُحْكِمَتْ ءايَـتُهُ ثُمَّ فُصِّلَتْ\n(The Ayat whereof are perfect and then explained in detail) This means perfect in its wording, detailed in its meaning. Thus, it is complete in its form and its meaning. This interpretation was reported from Mujahid and Qatadah, and Ibn Jarir At-Tabari preferred it. Concerning the meaning of Allah's statement,\nمِن لَّدُنْ حَكِيمٍ خَبِيرٍ\n(from One (Allah), Who is All-Wise, Well-Acquainted.) This means that it (the Qur'an) is from Allah, Who is Most Wise in His statements and His Laws, and Most Aware of the final outcome of matters.\nأَلاَّ تَعْبُدُواْ إِلاَّ اللَّهَ\n((Saying) worship none but Allah.) This means that this Qur'an descended, perfect and detailed, with the purpose of Allah's worship alone, without any partners. This is similar to the statement of Allah, the Exalted,\nوَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ نُوحِى إِلَيْهِ أَنَّهُ لا إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ أَنَاْ فَاعْبُدُونِ\n(And We did not send any Messenger before you but We revealed to him (saying): There is no God but I, so worship Me.) 21:25 It is similar to Allah's statement,\nوَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ\n(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming): `Worship Allah (Alone), and avoid Taghut (calling false deities.)')16:36 In reference to Allah's statement,\nإِنَّنِى لَكُمْ مِّنْهُ نَذِيرٌ وَبَشِيرٌ\n(Verily, I am unto you from Him a warner and a bringer of glad tidings.) This means, \"Verily, I am unto you a warner of the punishment if you oppose Him (Allah), and a bringer of the good news of reward if you obey Him.\" This meaning has been recorded in the authentic Hadith which states that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ ascended mount As-Safa and called out to his near relatives of the Quraysh tribe. When they gathered around him, he said,\n«يَا مَعْشَرَ قُرَيْشٍ أَرَأَيْتُمْ لَوْ أَخْبَرْتُكُمْ أَنَّ خَيْلًا تُصَبِّحُكُمْ أَلَسْتُمْ مُصَدِّقِيَّ؟»\n(O people of Quraysh, if I informed you that a cavalry was going to attack you in the morning, would you not believe me) They replied, \"We have not found you to be a liar.\" He said,\n«فَإِنِّي نَذِيرٌ لَكُمْ بَيْنَ يَدَي عَذَابٍ شَدِيد»\n(Verily I am a warner unto you before a severe punishment.) Concerning His statement,\nوَأَنِ اسْتَغْفِرُواْ رَبَّكُمْ ثُمَّ تُوبُواْ إِلَيْهِ يُمَتِّعْكُمْ مَّتَاعًا حَسَنًا إِلَى أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى وَيُؤْتِ كُلَّ ذِي فَضْلٍ فَضْلَهُ\n(And (commanding you): `Seek the forgiveness of your Lord, and turn to Him in repentance, that He may grant you good enjoyment, for a term appointed, and bestow His abounding grace to every owner of grace.) This means, \"I am commanding you to seek forgiveness from previous sins and to turn to Allah from future sins, and thereafter you abide by that.\"\nيُمَتِّعْكُمْ مَّتَاعًا حَسَنًا\n(that He may grant you good enjoyment,) This is in reference to this worldly life.\nإِلَى أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى وَيُؤْتِ كُلَّ ذِي فَضْلٍ فَضْلَهُ\n(for a term appointed, and bestow His abounding grace to every owner of grace.) This refers to the Hereafter, according to Qatadah. \"This is like the statement of Allah,\nمَنْ عَمِلَ صَـلِحاً مِّن ذَكَرٍ أَوْ أُنْثَى وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَلَنُحْيِيَنَّهُ حَيَوةً طَيِّبَةً\n(Whoever works righteousness -- whether male or female -- while a true believer, verily to him We will give a good life.)16:97 Concerning Allah's statement,\nوَإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَإِنِّي أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ كَبِيرٍ\n(But if you turn away, then I fear for you the torment of a Great Day.) This is a severe threat for whoever turns away from the commandments of Allah, the Exalted, and rejects His Messengers. Verily, the punishment will afflict such a person on the Day of Resurrection and there will be no escape from it.\nإِلَى الله مَرْجِعُكُمْ\n(To Allah is your return,) This is means your return on the Day of Judgement.\nوَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ\n(and He is able to do all things.) This means that He is capable of doing whatever He wishes, whether it be goodness towards His Awliya' (friends and allies), or vengeance upon His enemies. This also includes His ability to repeat the creation of His creatures on the Day of Resurrection.

This means that it (the Qur'an) is from Allah, Who is Most Wise in His statements and His Laws, and Most Aware of the final outcome of matters.\nأَلاَّ تَعْبُدُواْ إِلاَّ اللَّهَ\n((Saying) worship none but Allah.) This means that this Qur'an descended, perfect and detailed, with the purpose of Allah's worship alone, without any partners. This is similar to the statement of Allah, the Exalted,\nوَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ مِن رَّسُولٍ إِلاَّ نُوحِى إِلَيْهِ أَنَّهُ لا إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ أَنَاْ فَاعْبُدُونِ\n(And We did not send any Messenger before you but We revealed to him (saying): There is no God but I, so worship Me.) 21:25 It is similar to Allah's statement,\nوَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ\n(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming): `Worship Allah (Alone), and avoid Taghut (calling false deities.)')16:36 In reference to Allah's statement,\nإِنَّنِى لَكُمْ مِّنْهُ نَذِيرٌ وَبَشِيرٌ\n(Verily, I am unto you from Him a warner and a bringer of glad tidings.) This means, \"Verily, I am unto you a warner of the punishment if you oppose Him (Allah), and a bringer of the good news of reward if you obey Him.\" This meaning has been recorded in the authentic Hadith which states that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ ascended mount As-Safa and called out to his near relatives of the Quraysh tribe. When they gathered around him, he said,\n«يَا مَعْشَرَ قُرَيْشٍ أَرَأَيْتُمْ لَوْ أَخْبَرْتُكُمْ أَنَّ خَيْلًا تُصَبِّحُكُمْ أَلَسْتُمْ مُصَدِّقِيَّ؟»\n(O people of Quraysh, if I informed you that a cavalry was going to attack you in the morning, would you not believe me) They replied, \"We have not found you to be a liar.\" He said,\n«فَإِنِّي نَذِيرٌ لَكُمْ بَيْنَ يَدَي عَذَابٍ شَدِيد»\n(Verily I am a warner unto you before a severe punishment.) Concerning His statement,\nوَأَنِ اسْتَغْفِرُواْ رَبَّكُمْ ثُمَّ تُوبُواْ إِلَيْهِ يُمَتِّعْكُمْ مَّتَاعًا حَسَنًا إِلَى أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى وَيُؤْتِ كُلَّ ذِي فَضْلٍ فَضْلَهُ\n(And (commanding you): `Seek the forgiveness of your Lord, and turn to Him in repentance, that He may grant you good enjoyment, for a term appointed, and bestow His abounding grace to every owner of grace.) This means, \"I am commanding you to seek forgiveness from previous sins and to turn to Allah from future sins, and thereafter you abide by that.\"\nيُمَتِّعْكُمْ مَّتَاعًا حَسَنًا\n(that He may grant you good enjoyment,) This is in reference to this worldly life.\nإِلَى أَجَلٍ مُّسَمًّى وَيُؤْتِ كُلَّ ذِي فَضْلٍ فَضْلَهُ\n(for a term appointed, and bestow His abounding grace to every owner of grace.) This refers to the Hereafter, according to Qatadah. \"This is like the statement of Allah,\nمَنْ عَمِلَ صَـلِحاً مِّن ذَكَرٍ أَوْ أُنْثَى وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَلَنُحْيِيَنَّهُ حَيَوةً طَيِّبَةً\n(Whoever works righteousness -- whether male or female -- while a true believer, verily to him We will give a good life.)16:97 Concerning Allah's statement,\nوَإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَإِنِّي أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ كَبِيرٍ\n(But if you turn away, then I fear for you the torment of a Great Day.) This is a severe threat for whoever turns away from the commandments of Allah, the Exalted, and rejects His Messengers. Verily, the punishment will afflict such a person on the Day of Resurrection and there will be no escape from it.\nإِلَى الله مَرْجِعُكُمْ\n(To Allah is your return,) This is means your return on the Day of Judgement.\nوَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ\n(and He is able to do all things.) This means that He is capable of doing whatever He wishes, whether it be goodness towards His Awliya' (friends and allies), or vengeance upon His enemies. This also includes His ability to repeat the creation of His creatures on the Day of Resurrection. This section encourages fear, just as the previous section encourages hope.","verse_meta": {"id": 1477},"text_arabic_simple": "الر كتاب احكمت اياته ثم فصلت من لدن حكيم خبير ١ الا تعبدوا الا الله انني لكم منه نذير وبشير ٢ وان استغفروا ربكم ثم توبوا اليه يمتعكم متاعا حسنا الى اجل مسمى ويوت كل ذي فضل فضله وان تولوا فاني اخاف عليكم عذاب يوم كبير ٣ الى الله مرجعكم وهو على كل شيء قدير ٤الٓر ۚ كِتَـٰبٌ أُحْكِمَتْ ءَايَـٰتُهُۥ ثُمَّ فُصِّلَتْ مِن لَّدُنْ حَكِيمٍ خَبِيرٍ ١ أَلَّا تَعْبُدُوٓا۟ إِلَّا ٱللَّهَ ۚ إِنَّنِى لَكُم مِّنْهُ نَذِيرٌۭ وَبَشِيرٌۭ ٢ وَأَنِ ٱسْتَغْفِرُوا۟ رَبَّكُمْ ثُمَّ تُوبُوٓا۟ إِلَيْهِ يُمَتِّعْكُم مَّتَـٰعًا حَسَنًا إِلَىٰٓ أَجَلٍۢ مُّسَمًّۭى وَيُؤْتِ كُلَّ ذِى فَضْلٍۢ فَضْلَهُۥ ۖ وَإِن تَوَلَّوْا۟ فَإِنِّىٓ أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍۢ كَبِيرٍ ٣ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ مَرْجِعُكُمْ ۖ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍۢ قَدِيرٌ","text_arabic_uthmani": "الر كتاب احكمت اياته ثم فصلت من لدن حكيم خبير ١ الا تعبدوا الا الله انني لكم منه نذير وبشير ٢ وان استغفروا ربكم ثم توبوا اليه يمتعكم متاعا حسنا الى اجل مسمى ويوت كل ذي فضل فضله وان تولوا فاني اخاف عليكم عذاب يوم كبير ٣ الى الله مرجعكم وهو على كل شيء قدير","fetched_at": 1761763247.259242}

This place of nesting is also considered their place of deposit. `Ali bin Abi Talhah and others reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said concerning the statement, \nرِزْقُهَا وَيَعْلَمُ\n(And He knows its dwelling place) that it means where it resides. In reference to the statement, \nمُسْتَقَرَّهَا\n(and its deposit.) he (Ibn `Abbas) said it means where it will die.

He mentions that His Throne was over the water before that, just as Imam Ahmad recorded that `Imran bin Husayn said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«اقْبَلُوا الْبُشْرَى يَا بَنِي تَمِيم»\n(Accept the glad tidings, O tribe of Tamim!) They said, `Verily you have brought us glad tidings and you have given us.' Then he said,\n«اقْبَلُوا الْبُشْرَى يَا أَهْلَ الْيَمَن»\n(Accept the glad tidings, O people of Yemen!) They said, `We accept. Therefore, inform us about the beginning of this matter and how it was.' He said,\n«كَانَ اللهُ قَبْلَ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ، وَكَانَ عَرْشُهُ عَلَى الْمَاءِ، وَكَتَبَ فِي اللَّوْحِ الْمَحْفُوظِ ذِكْرَ كُلِّ شَيْء»\n(Allah was before everything and His Throne was over the water. He then wrote in the Preserved Tablet mentioning everything.) Then a man came to me and said, \"O `Imran, your she camel has escaped from her fetter.\" I then went out after her and I do not know what was said after I left.\" This Hadith has been recorded in the Two Sahihs of Al-Bukhari and Muslim with a variety of wordings. In Sahih Muslim, it is recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«إِنَّ اللهَ قَدَّرَ مَقَادِيرَ الْخَلَائِقِ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَخْلُقَ السَّموَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ بِخَمْسِينَ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ وَكَانَ عَرْشُهُ عَلَى الْمَاء»\n(Verily Allah measured the amount of sustenance of the creatures fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth, and His Throne was over the water.) Under the explanation of this verse, Al-Bukhari recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«قَالَ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ: أَنْفِقْ أُنْفِقْ عَلَيْك»\n(Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, said, `Spend and I will spend on you.') And he said,\n«يَدُ اللهِ مَلْأَى لَا يَغِيضُهَا نَفَقَةٌ، سَحَّاءُ اللَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَار»\n(Allah's Hand is full, and it is not diminished by spending throughout the night and the day.) He also said,\n«أَفَرَأَيْتُمْ مَا أَنْفَقَ مُنْذُ خَلَقَ السَّموَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ فَإِنَّهُ لَمْ يَغِضْ مَا فِي يَمِينِهِ، وَكَانَ عَرْشُهُ عَلَى الْمَاءِ، وَبِيَدِهِ الْمِيزَانُ يَخْفِضُ وَيَرْفَع»\n(Have you seen what has been spent since the creation of the heavens and the earth Verily it does not diminish what is in His Right Hand (in the slightest) and His Throne was over the water. In His Hand is the Scale and he lowers and raises it.) Concerning Allah's statement,\nلِيَبْلُوَكُمْ أَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلاً\n(that He might try you, which of you is the best in deeds.) This means that He created the heavens and the earth for the benefit of His servants, whom He created so that they may worship Him and not associate anything with Him as a partner. Allah did not create this creation (of the heavens and the earth) out of mere frivolity. This is similar to His statement,\nوَمَا خَلَقْنَا السَّمَآءَ وَالاٌّرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا بَـطِلاً ذَلِكَ ظَنُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنَ النَّارِ\n(And We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them without purpose! That is the consideration of those who disbelieve! Then woe to those who disbelieve from the Fire!) 38: 27 Allah the Exalted, said,\nأَفَحَسِبْتُمْ أَنَّمَا خَلَقْنَـكُمْ عَبَثاً وَأَنَّكُمْ إِلَيْنَا لاَ تُرْجَعُونَ - فَتَعَـلَى اللَّهُ الْمَلِكُ الْحَقُّ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ رَبُّ الْعَرْشِ الْكَرِيمِ\n(Did you think that We created you in play (without any purpose), and that you would not be brought back to Us So Exalted is Allah, the True King: there is no God but He, the Lord of the Supreme Throne!) 23:115-116 Allah, the Exalted, said,\nوَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالإِنسَ إِلاَّ لِيَعْبُدُونِ\n(And I (Allah) created not the Jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone).) 51:56 Concerning the statement of Allah,\nلِيَبْلُوَكُمْ\n(that He might try you,) It means so that He (Allah) may test you. Concerning the statement,\nأَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلاً\n(which of you is the best in deeds.) It is important to note here that Allah did not say, \"Which of you has done the most deeds.\" Rather, He said, \"Best in deeds.\" A deed cannot be considered a good deed until it is done sincerely for Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, and it must be in accordance with the legislation of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. Whenever a deed lacks one of these conditions, then it is null and void.\nThe Polytheists hasten their Torment by arguing against Resurrection after Death\nConcerning Allah's statement,\nوَلَئِن قُلْتَ إِنَّكُمْ مَّبْعُوثُونَ مِن بَعْدِ الْمَوْتِ\n(But if you were to say to them: \"You shall indeed be raised up after death.\") Allah, the Exalted, is saying, \"O Muhammad, if you were to inform these polytheists that Allah is going to resurrect them after their death, just as He created them originally (they would still reject).\" Even though they know that Allah, the Exalted, is the One Who created the heavens and the earth, just as He said,\nوَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ\n(And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say: \"Allah.\")43:87 Allah says,\nوَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُمْ مَّنْ خَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ وَسَخَّرَ الشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ\n(And if you were to ask them: \"Who has created the heavens and the earth and subjected the sun and the moon\" They will surely reply: \"Allah.\") 29:61 Even after their awareness of this (Allah's creating), they still reject the resurrection and the promised return on the Day of Judgement. Yet, in reference to ability, the resurrection is easier (for Allah to perform) than the original creation. As Allah said,\nوَهُوَ الَّذِى يَبْدَأُ الْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ وَهُوَ أَهْوَنُ عَلَيْهِ\n(And He it is Who originates the creation, then He will repeat it (after it has perished); and this is easier for Him.) 30:27 Allah also said,\nمَّا خَلْقُكُمْ وَلاَ بَعْثُكُمْ إِلاَّ كَنَفْسٍ وَحِدَةٍ\n(The creation of you all and the resurrection of you all are only as (the creation and resurrection of) a single person.) 31:28 Concerning the statement,\nإِنْ هَـذَا إِلاَّ سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ\n(This is nothing but obvious magic.) The polytheists say this due to their disbelief and obstinacy. They say, \"We do not believe your claim that resurrection will occur.\" They also say, \"He (Muhammad) only says this (resurrection of the dead) because he is bewitched, and he wants you to follow him in what his bewitchment tells him. Concerning Allah's statement,\nوَلَئِنْ أَخَّرْنَا عَنْهُمُ الْعَذَابَ إِلَى أُمَّةٍ مَّعْدُودَةٍ\n(And if We delay the torment for them till a determined term,) Allah, the Exalted, is saying \"If We delay the torment and the destruction of these polytheists until an appointed time and a period determined, and We promise them a specific time period (of life), they would still say, in rejection and haste;\nمَا يَحْبِسُهُ\n(What keeps it back) They mean by this, \"What delays this torment from overtaking us\" Both rejection and doubt are their very nature. Therefore, they have no escape or refuge from the torment.\nThe Meanings of the Word Ummah\nThe word Ummah is used in the Qur'an and Sunnah with a number of different meanings. Sometimes when it is used it means a specified period of time. An example is the statement of Allah, the Exalted, in this verse,\nإِلَى أُمَّةٍ مَّعْدُودَةٍ\n(till a determined Ummah (term),) This is also the meaning in the statement of Allah in Surah Yusuf,\nوَقَالَ الَّذِى نَجَا مِنْهُمَا وَادَّكَرَ بَعْدَ أُمَّةٍ\n(Then the man who was released, now after Ummah (some time) remembered.) 12:45 The word Ummah is also used to refer to the Imam (leader) who is followed. An example of this is in the statement of Allah,\nإِنَّ إِبْرَهِيمَ كَانَ أُمَّةً قَـنِتًا لِلَّهِ حَنِيفًا وَلَمْ يَكُ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ\n(Verily, Ibrahim was an Ummah, obedient to Allah, Hanif, and he was not of those who were polytheists.) 16:120 The word Ummah is also used to mean religion and religious creed. This is as Allah mentions concerning the polytheists, that they said,\nإِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّقْتَدُونَ\n(Verily, we found our fathers following a certain way and religion, and we will indeed follow their footsteps. ) 43:23 The word Ummah is also used to mean a group (of people). This is as Allah says,\nوَلَمَّا وَرَدَ مَآءَ مَدْيَنَ وَجَدَ عَلَيْهِ أُمَّةً مِّنَ النَّاسِ يَسْقُونَ\n(And when he arrived at the water (well) of Madyan, he found there a group of men watering (their flocks).) 28:23 Allah also said,\nوَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ\n(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah (Alone), and avoid Taghut.\") 16:36 Allah also said,\nوَلِكُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولٌ فَإِذَا جَآءَ رَسُولُهُمْ قُضِىَ بَيْنَهُمْ بِالْقِسْطِ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ\n(And for every Ummah there is a Messenger; when their Messenger comes, the matter will be judged between them with justice, and they will not be wronged.) 10:47 The meaning of Ummah here is those people who have had a Messenger sent among them. The meaning of Ummah in this context includes the believers and the disbelievers among them. This is like what has been recorded in Sahih Muslim,\n«وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَا يَسْمَعُ بِي أَحَدٌ مِنْ هَذِهِ الْأُمَّةِ يَهُودِيٌّ وَلَا نَصْرَانِيٌّ ثُمَّ لَا يُؤْمِنُ بِي إِلَّا دَخَلَ النَّار»\n(By He in Whose Hand is my soul! there is no one of this Ummah, whether he be a Jew or Christian, who hears of me and does not believe in me, except that he will enter the Hell- fire.) In reference to the Ummah of followers, then they are those who believe in the Messengers, as Allah said,\nكُنتُمْ خَيْرَ أُمَّةٍ أُخْرِجَتْ لِلنَّاسِ\n(You (the followers of Prophet Muhammad) are the best Ummah ever raised up for mankind.) 3:110 In the Sahih the Prophet said,\n«فَأَقُولُ: أُمَّتِي أُمَّتِي»\n(Then I will say, \"My Ummah (followers), my Ummah!\") The word Ummah is also used to mean a sect or party. An example of this usage is in the statement of Allah,\nوَمِن قَوْمِ مُوسَى أُمَّةٌ يَهْدُونَ بِالْحَقِّ وَبِهِ يَعْدِلُونَ\n(And of the people of Musa there is an Ummah who lead (the men) with truth and established justice therewith.) 7:159 Likewise is His statement,\nمِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ أُمَّةٌ قَآئِمَةٌ\n(A party of the People of the Scripture stand for the right.) 3:113","verse_meta": {"id": 1480},"text_arabic_simple": "وهو الذي خلق السماوات والارض في ستة ايام وكان عرشه على الماء ليبلوكم ايكم احسن عملا ولين قلت انكم مبعوثون من بعد الموت ليقولن الذين كفروا ان هاذا الا سحر مبين ٧ ولين اخرنا عنهم العذاب الى امة معدودة ليقولن ما يحبسه الا يوم ياتيهم ليس مصروفا عنهم وحاق بهم ما كانوا به يستهزيون ٨ ولين اذقنا الانسان منا رحمة ثم نزعناها منه انه لييوس كفور ٩ ولين اذقناه نعماء بعد ضراء مسته ليقولن ذهب السييات عني انه لفرح فخور ١٠ الا الذين صبروا وعملوا الصالحات اولايك لهم مغفرة واجر كبير ١١وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ فِى سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍۢ وَكَانَ عَرْشُهُۥ عَلَى ٱلْمَآءِ لِيَبْلُوَكُمْ أَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلًۭا ۗ وَلَئِن قُلْتَ إِنَّكُم مَّبْعُوثُونَ مِنۢ بَعْدِ ٱلْمَوْتِ لَيَقُولَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوٓا۟ إِنْ هَـٰذَآ إِلَّا سِحْرٌۭ مُّبِينٌۭ ٧ وَلَئِنْ أَخَّرْنَا عَنْهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابَ إِلَىٰٓ أُمَّةٍۢ مَّعْدُودَةٍۢ لَّيَقُولُنَّ مَا يَحْبِسُهُۥٓ ۗ أَلَا يَوْمَ يَأْتِيهِمْ لَيْسَ مَصْرُوفًا عَنْهُمْ وَحَاقَ بِهِم مَّا كَانُوا۟ بِهِۦ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ ٨ وَلَئِنْ أَذَقْنَا ٱلْإِنسَـٰنَ مِنَّا رَحْمَةًۭ ثُمَّ نَزَعْنَـٰهَا مِنْهُ إِنَّهُۥ لَيَـُٔوسٌۭ كَفُورٌۭ ٩ وَلَئِنْ أَذَقْنَـٰهُ نَعْمَآءَ بَعْدَ ضَرَّآءَ مَسَّتْهُ لَيَقُولَنَّ ذَهَبَ ٱلسَّيِّـَٔاتُ عَنِّىٓ ۚ إِنَّهُۥ لَفَرِحٌۭ فَخُورٌ ١٠ إِلَّا ٱلَّذِينَ صَبَرُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّـٰلِحَـٰتِ أُو۟لَـٰٓئِكَ لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةٌۭ وَأَجْرٌۭ كَبِيرٌۭ","text_arabic_uthmani": "وهو الذي خلق السماوات والارض في ستة ايام وكان عرشه على الماء ليبلوكم ايكم احسن عملا ولين قلت انكم مبعوثون من بعد الموت ليقولن الذين كفروا ان هاذا الا سحر مبين ٧ ولين اخرنا عنهم العذاب الى امة معدودة ليقولن ما يحبسه الا يوم ياتيهم ليس مصروفا عنهم وحاق بهم ما كانوا به يستهزيون ٨ ولين اذقنا الانسان منا رحمة ثم نزعناها منه انه لييوس كفور ٩ ولين اذقناه نعماء بعد ضراء مسته ليقولن ذهب السييات عني انه لفرح فخور ١٠ الا الذين صبروا وعملوا الصالحات اولايك لهم مغفرة واجر كبير","fetched_at": 1761763251.069561}

They said, `Verily you have brought us glad tidings and you have given us.' Then he said,\n«اقْبَلُوا الْبُشْرَى يَا أَهْلَ الْيَمَن»\n(Accept the glad tidings, O people of Yemen!) They said, `We accept. Therefore, inform us about the beginning of this matter and how it was.' He said,\n«كَانَ اللهُ قَبْلَ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ، وَكَانَ عَرْشُهُ عَلَى الْمَاءِ، وَكَتَبَ فِي اللَّوْحِ الْمَحْفُوظِ ذِكْرَ كُلِّ شَيْء»\n(Allah was before everything and His Throne was over the water. He then wrote in the Preserved Tablet mentioning everything.) Then a man came to me and said, \"O `Imran, your she camel has escaped from her fetter.\" I then went out after her and I do not know what was said after I left.\" This Hadith has been recorded in the Two Sahihs of Al-Bukhari and Muslim with a variety of wordings. In Sahih Muslim, it is recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«إِنَّ اللهَ قَدَّرَ مَقَادِيرَ الْخَلَائِقِ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَخْلُقَ السَّموَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ بِخَمْسِينَ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ وَكَانَ عَرْشُهُ عَلَى الْمَاء»\n(Verily Allah measured the amount of sustenance of the creatures fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth, and His Throne was over the water.) Under the explanation of this verse, Al-Bukhari recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«قَالَ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ: أَنْفِقْ أُنْفِقْ عَلَيْك»\n(Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, said, `Spend and I will spend on you.') And he said,\n«يَدُ اللهِ مَلْأَى لَا يَغِيضُهَا نَفَقَةٌ، سَحَّاءُ اللَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَار»\n(Allah's Hand is full, and it is not diminished by spending throughout the night and the day.) He also said,\n«أَفَرَأَيْتُمْ مَا أَنْفَقَ مُنْذُ خَلَقَ السَّموَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ فَإِنَّهُ لَمْ يَغِضْ مَا فِي يَمِينِهِ، وَكَانَ عَرْشُهُ عَلَى الْمَاءِ، وَبِيَدِهِ الْمِيزَانُ يَخْفِضُ وَيَرْفَع»\n(Have you seen what has been spent since the creation of the heavens and the earth Verily it does not diminish what is in His Right Hand (in the slightest) and His Throne was over the water. In His Hand is the Scale and he lowers and raises it.) Concerning Allah's statement,\nلِيَبْلُوَكُمْ أَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلاً\n(that He might try you, which of you is the best in deeds.) This means that He created the heavens and the earth for the benefit of His servants, whom He created so that they may worship Him and not associate anything with Him as a partner. Allah did not create this creation (of the heavens and the earth) out of mere frivolity. This is similar to His statement,\nوَمَا خَلَقْنَا السَّمَآءَ وَالاٌّرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا بَـطِلاً ذَلِكَ ظَنُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنَ النَّارِ\n(And We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them without purpose! That is the consideration of those who disbelieve! Then woe to those who disbelieve from the Fire!) 38: 27 Allah the Exalted, said,\nأَفَحَسِبْتُمْ أَنَّمَا خَلَقْنَـكُمْ عَبَثاً وَأَنَّكُمْ إِلَيْنَا لاَ تُرْجَعُونَ - فَتَعَـلَى اللَّهُ الْمَلِكُ الْحَقُّ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ رَبُّ الْعَرْشِ الْكَرِيمِ\n(Did you think that We created you in play (without any purpose), and that you would not be brought back to Us So Exalted is Allah, the True King: there is no God but He, the Lord of the Supreme Throne!) 23:115-116 Allah, the Exalted, said,\nوَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالإِنسَ إِلاَّ لِيَعْبُدُونِ\n(And I (Allah) created not the Jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone).) 51:56 Concerning the statement of Allah,\nلِيَبْلُوَكُمْ\n(that He might try you,) It means so that He (Allah) may test you. Concerning the statement,\nأَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلاً\n(which of you is the best in deeds.) It is important to note here that Allah did not say, \"Which of you has done the most deeds.\" Rather, He said, \"Best in deeds.\" A deed cannot be considered a good deed until it is done sincerely for Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, and it must be in accordance with the legislation of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. Whenever a deed lacks one of these conditions, then it is null and void.\nThe Polytheists hasten their Torment by arguing against Resurrection after Death\nConcerning Allah's statement,\nوَلَئِن قُلْتَ إِنَّكُمْ مَّبْعُوثُونَ مِن بَعْدِ الْمَوْتِ\n(But if you were to say to them: \"You shall indeed be raised up after death.\") Allah, the Exalted, is saying, \"O Muhammad, if you were to inform these polytheists that Allah is going to resurrect them after their death, just as He created them originally (they would still reject).\" Even though they know that Allah, the Exalted, is the One Who created the heavens and the earth, just as He said,\nوَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ\n(And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say: \"Allah.\")43:87 Allah says,\nوَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُمْ مَّنْ خَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ وَسَخَّرَ الشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ\n(And if you were to ask them: \"Who has created the heavens and the earth and subjected the sun and the moon\" They will surely reply: \"Allah.\") 29:61 Even after their awareness of this (Allah's creating), they still reject the resurrection and the promised return on the Day of Judgement. Yet, in reference to ability, the resurrection is easier (for Allah to perform) than the original creation. As Allah said,\nوَهُوَ الَّذِى يَبْدَأُ الْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ وَهُوَ أَهْوَنُ عَلَيْهِ\n(And He it is Who originates the creation, then He will repeat it (after it has perished); and this is easier for Him.) 30:27 Allah also said,\nمَّا خَلْقُكُمْ وَلاَ بَعْثُكُمْ إِلاَّ كَنَفْسٍ وَحِدَةٍ\n(The creation of you all and the resurrection of you all are only as (the creation and resurrection of) a single person.) 31:28 Concerning the statement,\nإِنْ هَـذَا إِلاَّ سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ\n(This is nothing but obvious magic.) The polytheists say this due to their disbelief and obstinacy. They say, \"We do not believe your claim that resurrection will occur.\" They also say, \"He (Muhammad) only says this (resurrection of the dead) because he is bewitched, and he wants you to follow him in what his bewitchment tells him. Concerning Allah's statement,\nوَلَئِنْ أَخَّرْنَا عَنْهُمُ الْعَذَابَ إِلَى أُمَّةٍ مَّعْدُودَةٍ\n(And if We delay the torment for them till a determined term,) Allah, the Exalted, is saying \"If We delay the torment and the destruction of these polytheists until an appointed time and a period determined, and We promise them a specific time period (of life), they would still say, in rejection and haste;\nمَا يَحْبِسُهُ\n(What keeps it back) They mean by this, \"What delays this torment from overtaking us\" Both rejection and doubt are their very nature. Therefore, they have no escape or refuge from the torment.\nThe Meanings of the Word Ummah\nThe word Ummah is used in the Qur'an and Sunnah with a number of different meanings. Sometimes when it is used it means a specified period of time. An example is the statement of Allah, the Exalted, in this verse,\nإِلَى أُمَّةٍ مَّعْدُودَةٍ\n(till a determined Ummah (term),) This is also the meaning in the statement of Allah in Surah Yusuf,\nوَقَالَ الَّذِى نَجَا مِنْهُمَا وَادَّكَرَ بَعْدَ أُمَّةٍ\n(Then the man who was released, now after Ummah (some time) remembered.) 12:45 The word Ummah is also used to refer to the Imam (leader) who is followed. An example of this is in the statement of Allah,\nإِنَّ إِبْرَهِيمَ كَانَ أُمَّةً قَـنِتًا لِلَّهِ حَنِيفًا وَلَمْ يَكُ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ\n(Verily, Ibrahim was an Ummah, obedient to Allah, Hanif, and he was not of those who were polytheists.) 16:120 The word Ummah is also used to mean religion and religious creed. This is as Allah mentions concerning the polytheists, that they said,\nإِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّقْتَدُونَ\n(Verily, we found our fathers following a certain way and religion, and we will indeed follow their footsteps. ) 43:23 The word Ummah is also used to mean a group (of people). This is as Allah says,\nوَلَمَّا وَرَدَ مَآءَ مَدْيَنَ وَجَدَ عَلَيْهِ أُمَّةً مِّنَ النَّاسِ يَسْقُونَ\n(And when he arrived at the water (well) of Madyan, he found there a group of men watering (their flocks).) 28:23 Allah also said,\nوَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ\n(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah (Alone), and avoid Taghut.\") 16:36 Allah also said,\nوَلِكُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولٌ فَإِذَا جَآءَ رَسُولُهُمْ قُضِىَ بَيْنَهُمْ بِالْقِسْطِ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ\n(And for every Ummah there is a Messenger; when their Messenger comes, the matter will be judged between them with justice, and they will not be wronged.) 10:47 The meaning of Ummah here is those people who have had a Messenger sent among them. The meaning of Ummah in this context includes the believers and the disbelievers among them. This is like what has been recorded in Sahih Muslim,\n«وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَا يَسْمَعُ بِي أَحَدٌ مِنْ هَذِهِ الْأُمَّةِ يَهُودِيٌّ وَلَا نَصْرَانِيٌّ ثُمَّ لَا يُؤْمِنُ بِي إِلَّا دَخَلَ النَّار»\n(By He in Whose Hand is my soul! there is no one of this Ummah, whether he be a Jew or Christian, who hears of me and does not believe in me, except that he will enter the Hell- fire.) In reference to the Ummah of followers, then they are those who believe in the Messengers, as Allah said,\nكُنتُمْ خَيْرَ أُمَّةٍ أُخْرِجَتْ لِلنَّاسِ\n(You (the followers of Prophet Muhammad) are the best Ummah ever raised up for mankind.) 3:110 In the Sahih the Prophet said,\n«فَأَقُولُ: أُمَّتِي أُمَّتِي»\n(Then I will say, \"My Ummah (followers), my Ummah!\") The word Ummah is also used to mean a sect or party. An example of this usage is in the statement of Allah,\nوَمِن قَوْمِ مُوسَى أُمَّةٌ يَهْدُونَ بِالْحَقِّ وَبِهِ يَعْدِلُونَ\n(And of the people of Musa there is an Ummah who lead (the men) with truth and established justice therewith.) 7:159 Likewise is His statement,\nمِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ أُمَّةٌ قَآئِمَةٌ\n(A party of the People of the Scripture stand for the right.) 3:113","verse_meta": {"id": 1481},"text_arabic_simple": "وهو الذي خلق السماوات والارض في ستة ايام وكان عرشه على الماء ليبلوكم ايكم احسن عملا ولين قلت انكم مبعوثون من بعد الموت ليقولن الذين كفروا ان هاذا الا سحر مبين ٧ ولين اخرنا عنهم العذاب الى امة معدودة ليقولن ما يحبسه الا يوم ياتيهم ليس مصروفا عنهم وحاق بهم ما كانوا به يستهزيون ٨ ولين اذقنا الانسان منا رحمة ثم نزعناها منه انه لييوس كفور ٩ ولين اذقناه نعماء بعد ضراء مسته ليقولن ذهب السييات عني انه لفرح فخور ١٠ الا الذين صبروا وعملوا الصالحات اولايك لهم مغفرة واجر كبير ١١وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ فِى سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍۢ وَكَانَ عَرْشُهُۥ عَلَى ٱلْمَآءِ لِيَبْلُوَكُمْ أَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلًۭا ۗ وَلَئِن قُلْتَ إِنَّكُم مَّبْعُوثُونَ مِنۢ بَعْدِ ٱلْمَوْتِ لَيَقُولَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوٓا۟ إِنْ هَـٰذَآ إِلَّا سِحْرٌۭ مُّبِينٌۭ ٧ وَلَئِنْ أَخَّرْنَا عَنْهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابَ إِلَىٰٓ أُمَّةٍۢ مَّعْدُودَةٍۢ لَّيَقُولُنَّ مَا يَحْبِسُهُۥٓ ۗ أَلَا يَوْمَ يَأْتِيهِمْ لَيْسَ مَصْرُوفًا عَنْهُمْ وَحَاقَ بِهِم مَّا كَانُوا۟ بِهِۦ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ ٨ وَلَئِنْ أَذَقْنَا ٱلْإِنسَـٰنَ مِنَّا رَحْمَةًۭ ثُمَّ نَزَعْنَـٰهَا مِنْهُ إِنَّهُۥ لَيَـُٔوسٌۭ كَفُورٌۭ ٩ وَلَئِنْ أَذَقْنَـٰهُ نَعْمَآءَ بَعْدَ ضَرَّآءَ مَسَّتْهُ لَيَقُولَنَّ ذَهَبَ ٱلسَّيِّـَٔاتُ عَنِّىٓ ۚ إِنَّهُۥ لَفَرِحٌۭ فَخُورٌ ١٠ إِلَّا ٱلَّذِينَ صَبَرُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّـٰلِحَـٰتِ أُو۟لَـٰٓئِكَ لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةٌۭ وَأَجْرٌۭ كَبِيرٌۭ","text_arabic_uthmani": "وهو الذي خلق السماوات والارض في ستة ايام وكان عرشه على الماء ليبلوكم ايكم احسن عملا ولين قلت انكم مبعوثون من بعد الموت ليقولن الذين كفروا ان هاذا الا سحر مبين ٧ ولين اخرنا عنهم العذاب الى امة معدودة ليقولن ما يحبسه الا يوم ياتيهم ليس مصروفا عنهم وحاق بهم ما كانوا به يستهزيون ٨ ولين اذقنا الانسان منا رحمة ثم نزعناها منه انه لييوس كفور ٩ ولين اذقناه نعماء بعد ضراء مسته ليقولن ذهب السييات عني انه لفرح فخور ١٠ الا الذين صبروا وعملوا الصالحات اولايك لهم مغفرة واجر كبير","fetched_at": 1761763252.396383}

Whenever a deed lacks one of these conditions, then it is null and void.\nThe Polytheists hasten their Torment by arguing against Resurrection after Death\nConcerning Allah's statement,\nوَلَئِن قُلْتَ إِنَّكُمْ مَّبْعُوثُونَ مِن بَعْدِ الْمَوْتِ\n(But if you were to say to them: \"You shall indeed be raised up after death.\") Allah, the Exalted, is saying, \"O Muhammad, if you were to inform these polytheists that Allah is going to resurrect them after their death, just as He created them originally (they would still reject).\" Even though they know that Allah, the Exalted, is the One Who created the heavens and the earth, just as He said,\nوَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ\n(And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say: \"Allah.\")43:87 Allah says,\nوَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُمْ مَّنْ خَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ وَسَخَّرَ الشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ\n(And if you were to ask them: \"Who has created the heavens and the earth and subjected the sun and the moon\" They will surely reply: \"Allah.\") 29:61 Even after their awareness of this (Allah's creating), they still reject the resurrection and the promised return on the Day of Judgement. Yet, in reference to ability, the resurrection is easier (for Allah to perform) than the original creation. As Allah said,\nوَهُوَ الَّذِى يَبْدَأُ الْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ وَهُوَ أَهْوَنُ عَلَيْهِ\n(And He it is Who originates the creation, then He will repeat it (after it has perished); and this is easier for Him.) 30:27 Allah also said,\nمَّا خَلْقُكُمْ وَلاَ بَعْثُكُمْ إِلاَّ كَنَفْسٍ وَحِدَةٍ\n(The creation of you all and the resurrection of you all are only as (the creation and resurrection of) a single person.) 31:28 Concerning the statement,\nإِنْ هَـذَا إِلاَّ سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ\n(This is nothing but obvious magic.) The polytheists say this due to their disbelief and obstinacy. They say, \"We do not believe your claim that resurrection will occur.\" They also say, \"He (Muhammad) only says this (resurrection of the dead) because he is bewitched, and he wants you to follow him in what his bewitchment tells him. Concerning Allah's statement,\nوَلَئِنْ أَخَّرْنَا عَنْهُمُ الْعَذَابَ إِلَى أُمَّةٍ مَّعْدُودَةٍ\n(And if We delay the torment for them till a determined term,) Allah, the Exalted, is saying \"If We delay the torment and the destruction of these polytheists until an appointed time and a period determined, and We promise them a specific time period (of life), they would still say, in rejection and haste;\nمَا يَحْبِسُهُ\n(What keeps it back) They mean by this, \"What delays this torment from overtaking us\" Both rejection and doubt are their very nature. Therefore, they have no escape or refuge from the torment.\nThe Meanings of the Word Ummah\nThe word Ummah is used in the Qur'an and Sunnah with a number of different meanings. Sometimes when it is used it means a specified period of time. An example is the statement of Allah, the Exalted, in this verse,\nإِلَى أُمَّةٍ مَّعْدُودَةٍ\n(till a determined Ummah (term),) This is also the meaning in the statement of Allah in Surah Yusuf,\nوَقَالَ الَّذِى نَجَا مِنْهُمَا وَادَّكَرَ بَعْدَ أُمَّةٍ\n(Then the man who was released, now after Ummah (some time) remembered.) 12:45 The word Ummah is also used to refer to the Imam (leader) who is followed. An example of this is in the statement of Allah,\nإِنَّ إِبْرَهِيمَ كَانَ أُمَّةً قَـنِتًا لِلَّهِ حَنِيفًا وَلَمْ يَكُ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ\n(Verily, Ibrahim was an Ummah, obedient to Allah, Hanif, and he was not of those who were polytheists.) 16:120 The word Ummah is also used to mean religion and religious creed. This is as Allah mentions concerning the polytheists, that they said,\nإِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّقْتَدُونَ\n(Verily, we found our fathers following a certain way and religion, and we will indeed follow their footsteps. ) 43:23 The word Ummah is also used to mean a group (of people). This is as Allah says,\nوَلَمَّا وَرَدَ مَآءَ مَدْيَنَ وَجَدَ عَلَيْهِ أُمَّةً مِّنَ النَّاسِ يَسْقُونَ\n(And when he arrived at the water (well) of Madyan, he found there a group of men watering (their flocks).) 28:23 Allah also said,\nوَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ\n(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah (Alone), and avoid Taghut.\") 16:36 Allah also said,\nوَلِكُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولٌ فَإِذَا جَآءَ رَسُولُهُمْ قُضِىَ بَيْنَهُمْ بِالْقِسْطِ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ\n(And for every Ummah there is a Messenger; when their Messenger comes, the matter will be judged between them with justice, and they will not be wronged.) 10:47 The meaning of Ummah here is those people who have had a Messenger sent among them. The meaning of Ummah in this context includes the believers and the disbelievers among them. This is like what has been recorded in Sahih Muslim,\n«وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَا يَسْمَعُ بِي أَحَدٌ مِنْ هَذِهِ الْأُمَّةِ يَهُودِيٌّ وَلَا نَصْرَانِيٌّ ثُمَّ لَا يُؤْمِنُ بِي إِلَّا دَخَلَ النَّار»\n(By He in Whose Hand is my soul! there is no one of this Ummah, whether he be a Jew or Christian, who hears of me and does not believe in me, except that he will enter the Hell- fire.) In reference to the Ummah of followers, then they are those who believe in the Messengers, as Allah said,\nكُنتُمْ خَيْرَ أُمَّةٍ أُخْرِجَتْ لِلنَّاسِ\n(You (the followers of Prophet Muhammad) are the best Ummah ever raised up for mankind.) 3:110 In the Sahih the Prophet said,\n«فَأَقُولُ: أُمَّتِي أُمَّتِي»\n(Then I will say, \"My Ummah (followers), my Ummah!\") The word Ummah is also used to mean a sect or party. An example of this usage is in the statement of Allah,\nوَمِن قَوْمِ مُوسَى أُمَّةٌ يَهْدُونَ بِالْحَقِّ وَبِهِ يَعْدِلُونَ\n(And of the people of Musa there is an Ummah who lead (the men) with truth and established justice therewith.) 7:159 Likewise is His statement,\nمِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ أُمَّةٌ قَآئِمَةٌ\n(A party of the People of the Scripture stand for the right.) 3:113","verse_meta": {"id": 1482},"text_arabic_simple": "وهو الذي خلق السماوات والارض في ستة ايام وكان عرشه على الماء ليبلوكم ايكم احسن عملا ولين قلت انكم مبعوثون من بعد الموت ليقولن الذين كفروا ان هاذا الا سحر مبين ٧ ولين اخرنا عنهم العذاب الى امة معدودة ليقولن ما يحبسه الا يوم ياتيهم ليس مصروفا عنهم وحاق بهم ما كانوا به يستهزيون ٨ ولين اذقنا الانسان منا رحمة ثم نزعناها منه انه لييوس كفور ٩ ولين اذقناه نعماء بعد ضراء مسته ليقولن ذهب السييات عني انه لفرح فخور ١٠ الا الذين صبروا وعملوا الصالحات اولايك لهم مغفرة واجر كبير ١١وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ فِى سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍۢ وَكَانَ عَرْشُهُۥ عَلَى ٱلْمَآءِ لِيَبْلُوَكُمْ أَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلًۭا ۗ وَلَئِن قُلْتَ إِنَّكُم مَّبْعُوثُونَ مِنۢ بَعْدِ ٱلْمَوْتِ لَيَقُولَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوٓا۟ إِنْ هَـٰذَآ إِلَّا سِحْرٌۭ مُّبِينٌۭ ٧ وَلَئِنْ أَخَّرْنَا عَنْهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابَ إِلَىٰٓ أُمَّةٍۢ مَّعْدُودَةٍۢ لَّيَقُولُنَّ مَا يَحْبِسُهُۥٓ ۗ أَلَا يَوْمَ يَأْتِيهِمْ لَيْسَ مَصْرُوفًا عَنْهُمْ وَحَاقَ بِهِم مَّا كَانُوا۟ بِهِۦ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ ٨ وَلَئِنْ أَذَقْنَا ٱلْإِنسَـٰنَ مِنَّا رَحْمَةًۭ ثُمَّ نَزَعْنَـٰهَا مِنْهُ إِنَّهُۥ لَيَـُٔوسٌۭ كَفُورٌۭ ٩ وَلَئِنْ أَذَقْنَـٰهُ نَعْمَآءَ بَعْدَ ضَرَّآءَ مَسَّتْهُ لَيَقُولَنَّ ذَهَبَ ٱلسَّيِّـَٔاتُ عَنِّىٓ ۚ إِنَّهُۥ لَفَرِحٌۭ فَخُورٌ ١٠ إِلَّا ٱلَّذِينَ صَبَرُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّـٰلِحَـٰتِ أُو۟لَـٰٓئِكَ لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةٌۭ وَأَجْرٌۭ كَبِيرٌۭ","text_arabic_uthmani": "وهو الذي خلق السماوات والارض في ستة ايام وكان عرشه على الماء ليبلوكم ايكم احسن عملا ولين قلت انكم مبعوثون من بعد الموت ليقولن الذين كفروا ان هاذا الا سحر مبين ٧ ولين اخرنا عنهم العذاب الى امة معدودة ليقولن ما يحبسه الا يوم ياتيهم ليس مصروفا عنهم وحاق بهم ما كانوا به يستهزيون ٨ ولين اذقنا الانسان منا رحمة ثم نزعناها منه انه لييوس كفور ٩ ولين اذقناه نعماء بعد ضراء مسته ليقولن ذهب السييات عني انه لفرح فخور ١٠ الا الذين صبروا وعملوا الصالحات اولايك لهم مغفرة واجر كبير","fetched_at": 1761763253.686757}

He mentions that His Throne was over the water before that, just as Imam Ahmad recorded that `Imran bin Husayn said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«اقْبَلُوا الْبُشْرَى يَا بَنِي تَمِيم»\n(Accept the glad tidings, O tribe of Tamim!) They said, `Verily you have brought us glad tidings and you have given us.' Then he said,\n«اقْبَلُوا الْبُشْرَى يَا أَهْلَ الْيَمَن»\n(Accept the glad tidings, O people of Yemen!) They said, `We accept. Therefore, inform us about the beginning of this matter and how it was.' He said,\n«كَانَ اللهُ قَبْلَ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ، وَكَانَ عَرْشُهُ عَلَى الْمَاءِ، وَكَتَبَ فِي اللَّوْحِ الْمَحْفُوظِ ذِكْرَ كُلِّ شَيْء»\n(Allah was before everything and His Throne was over the water. He then wrote in the Preserved Tablet mentioning everything.) Then a man came to me and said, \"O `Imran, your she camel has escaped from her fetter.\" I then went out after her and I do not know what was said after I left.\" This Hadith has been recorded in the Two Sahihs of Al-Bukhari and Muslim with a variety of wordings. In Sahih Muslim, it is recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«إِنَّ اللهَ قَدَّرَ مَقَادِيرَ الْخَلَائِقِ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَخْلُقَ السَّموَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ بِخَمْسِينَ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ وَكَانَ عَرْشُهُ عَلَى الْمَاء»\n(Verily Allah measured the amount of sustenance of the creatures fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth, and His Throne was over the water.) Under the explanation of this verse, Al-Bukhari recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«قَالَ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ: أَنْفِقْ أُنْفِقْ عَلَيْك»\n(Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, said, `Spend and I will spend on you.') And he said,\n«يَدُ اللهِ مَلْأَى لَا يَغِيضُهَا نَفَقَةٌ، سَحَّاءُ اللَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَار»\n(Allah's Hand is full, and it is not diminished by spending throughout the night and the day.) He also said,\n«أَفَرَأَيْتُمْ مَا أَنْفَقَ مُنْذُ خَلَقَ السَّموَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ فَإِنَّهُ لَمْ يَغِضْ مَا فِي يَمِينِهِ، وَكَانَ عَرْشُهُ عَلَى الْمَاءِ، وَبِيَدِهِ الْمِيزَانُ يَخْفِضُ وَيَرْفَع»\n(Have you seen what has been spent since the creation of the heavens and the earth Verily it does not diminish what is in His Right Hand (in the slightest) and His Throne was over the water. In His Hand is the Scale and he lowers and raises it.) Concerning Allah's statement,\nلِيَبْلُوَكُمْ أَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلاً\n(that He might try you, which of you is the best in deeds.) This means that He created the heavens and the earth for the benefit of His servants, whom He created so that they may worship Him and not associate anything with Him as a partner. Allah did not create this creation (of the heavens and the earth) out of mere frivolity. This is similar to His statement,\nوَمَا خَلَقْنَا السَّمَآءَ وَالاٌّرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا بَـطِلاً ذَلِكَ ظَنُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنَ النَّارِ\n(And We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them without purpose! That is the consideration of those who disbelieve! Then woe to those who disbelieve from the Fire!) 38: 27 Allah the Exalted, said,\nأَفَحَسِبْتُمْ أَنَّمَا خَلَقْنَـكُمْ عَبَثاً وَأَنَّكُمْ إِلَيْنَا لاَ تُرْجَعُونَ - فَتَعَـلَى اللَّهُ الْمَلِكُ الْحَقُّ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ رَبُّ الْعَرْشِ الْكَرِيمِ\n(Did you think that We created you in play (without any purpose), and that you would not be brought back to Us So Exalted is Allah, the True King: there is no God but He, the Lord of the Supreme Throne!) 23:115-116 Allah, the Exalted, said,\nوَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالإِنسَ إِلاَّ لِيَعْبُدُونِ\n(And I (Allah) created not the Jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone).) 51:56 Concerning the statement of Allah,\nلِيَبْلُوَكُمْ\n(that He might try you,) It means so that He (Allah) may test you. Concerning the statement,\nأَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلاً\n(which of you is the best in deeds.) It is important to note here that Allah did not say, \"Which of you has done the most deeds.\" Rather, He said, \"Best in deeds.\" A deed cannot be considered a good deed until it is done sincerely for Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, and it must be in accordance with the legislation of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. Whenever a deed lacks one of these conditions, then it is null and void.\nThe Polytheists hasten their Torment by arguing against Resurrection after Death\nConcerning Allah's statement,\nوَلَئِن قُلْتَ إِنَّكُمْ مَّبْعُوثُونَ مِن بَعْدِ الْمَوْتِ\n(But if you were to say to them: \"You shall indeed be raised up after death.\") Allah, the Exalted, is saying, \"O Muhammad, if you were to inform these polytheists that Allah is going to resurrect them after their death, just as He created them originally (they would still reject).\" Even though they know that Allah, the Exalted, is the One Who created the heavens and the earth, just as He said,\nوَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ\n(And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say: \"Allah.\")43:87 Allah says,\nوَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُمْ مَّنْ خَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ وَسَخَّرَ الشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ\n(And if you were to ask them: \"Who has created the heavens and the earth and subjected the sun and the moon\" They will surely reply: \"Allah.\") 29:61 Even after their awareness of this (Allah's creating), they still reject the resurrection and the promised return on the Day of Judgement.

The polytheists say this due to their disbelief and obstinacy. They say, \"We do not believe your claim that resurrection will occur.\" They also say, \"He (Muhammad) only says this (resurrection of the dead) because he is bewitched, and he wants you to follow him in what his bewitchment tells him.

This is as Allah says,\nوَلَمَّا وَرَدَ مَآءَ مَدْيَنَ وَجَدَ عَلَيْهِ أُمَّةً مِّنَ النَّاسِ يَسْقُونَ\n(And when he arrived at the water (well) of Madyan, he found there a group of men watering (their flocks).) 28:23 Allah also said,\nوَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ\n(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah (Alone), and avoid Taghut.\") 16:36 Allah also said,\nوَلِكُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولٌ فَإِذَا جَآءَ رَسُولُهُمْ قُضِىَ بَيْنَهُمْ بِالْقِسْطِ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ\n(And for every Ummah there is a Messenger; when their Messenger comes, the matter will be judged between them with justice, and they will not be wronged.) 10:47 The meaning of Ummah here is those people who have had a Messenger sent among them.

In reference to the Ummah of followers, then they are those who believe in the Messengers, as Allah said,\nكُنتُمْ خَيْرَ أُمَّةٍ أُخْرِجَتْ لِلنَّاسِ\n(You (the followers of Prophet Muhammad) are the best Ummah ever raised up for mankind.) 3:110 In the Sahih the Prophet said,\n«فَأَقُولُ: أُمَّتِي أُمَّتِي»\n(Then I will say, \"My Ummah (followers), my Ummah!\") The word Ummah is also used to mean a sect or party. An example of this usage is in the statement of Allah,\nوَمِن قَوْمِ مُوسَى أُمَّةٌ يَهْدُونَ بِالْحَقِّ وَبِهِ يَعْدِلُونَ\n(And of the people of Musa there is an Ummah who lead (the men) with truth and established justice therewith.) 7:159 Likewise is His statement,\nمِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ أُمَّةٌ قَآئِمَةٌ\n(A party of the People of the Scripture stand for the right.) 3:113","verse_meta": {"id": 1483},"text_arabic_simple": "وهو الذي خلق السماوات والارض في ستة ايام وكان عرشه على الماء ليبلوكم ايكم احسن عملا ولين قلت انكم مبعوثون من بعد الموت ليقولن الذين كفروا ان هاذا الا سحر مبين ٧ ولين اخرنا عنهم العذاب الى امة معدودة ليقولن ما يحبسه الا يوم ياتيهم ليس مصروفا عنهم وحاق بهم ما كانوا به يستهزيون ٨ ولين اذقنا الانسان منا رحمة ثم نزعناها منه انه لييوس كفور ٩ ولين اذقناه نعماء بعد ضراء مسته ليقولن ذهب السييات عني انه لفرح فخور ١٠ الا الذين صبروا وعملوا الصالحات اولايك لهم مغفرة واجر كبير ١١وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ فِى سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍۢ وَكَانَ عَرْشُهُۥ عَلَى ٱلْمَآءِ لِيَبْلُوَكُمْ أَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلًۭا ۗ وَلَئِن قُلْتَ إِنَّكُم مَّبْعُوثُونَ مِنۢ بَعْدِ ٱلْمَوْتِ لَيَقُولَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوٓا۟ إِنْ هَـٰذَآ إِلَّا سِحْرٌۭ مُّبِينٌۭ ٧ وَلَئِنْ أَخَّرْنَا عَنْهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابَ إِلَىٰٓ أُمَّةٍۢ مَّعْدُودَةٍۢ لَّيَقُولُنَّ مَا يَحْبِسُهُۥٓ ۗ أَلَا يَوْمَ يَأْتِيهِمْ لَيْسَ مَصْرُوفًا عَنْهُمْ وَحَاقَ بِهِم مَّا كَانُوا۟ بِهِۦ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ ٨ وَلَئِنْ أَذَقْنَا ٱلْإِنسَـٰنَ مِنَّا رَحْمَةًۭ ثُمَّ نَزَعْنَـٰهَا مِنْهُ إِنَّهُۥ لَيَـُٔوسٌۭ كَفُورٌۭ ٩ وَلَئِنْ أَذَقْنَـٰهُ نَعْمَآءَ بَعْدَ ضَرَّآءَ مَسَّتْهُ لَيَقُولَنَّ ذَهَبَ ٱلسَّيِّـَٔاتُ عَنِّىٓ ۚ إِنَّهُۥ لَفَرِحٌۭ فَخُورٌ ١٠ إِلَّا ٱلَّذِينَ صَبَرُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّـٰلِحَـٰتِ أُو۟لَـٰٓئِكَ لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةٌۭ وَأَجْرٌۭ كَبِيرٌۭ","text_arabic_uthmani": "وهو الذي خلق السماوات والارض في ستة ايام وكان عرشه على الماء ليبلوكم ايكم احسن عملا ولين قلت انكم مبعوثون من بعد الموت ليقولن الذين كفروا ان هاذا الا سحر مبين ٧ ولين اخرنا عنهم العذاب الى امة معدودة ليقولن ما يحبسه الا يوم ياتيهم ليس مصروفا عنهم وحاق بهم ما كانوا به يستهزيون ٨ ولين اذقنا الانسان منا رحمة ثم نزعناها منه انه لييوس كفور ٩ ولين اذقناه نعماء بعد ضراء مسته ليقولن ذهب السييات عني انه لفرح فخور ١٠ الا الذين صبروا وعملوا الصالحات اولايك لهم مغفرة واجر كبير","fetched_at": 1761763255.114847}

He mentions that His Throne was over the water before that, just as Imam Ahmad recorded that `Imran bin Husayn said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«اقْبَلُوا الْبُشْرَى يَا بَنِي تَمِيم»\n(Accept the glad tidings, O tribe of Tamim!) They said, `Verily you have brought us glad tidings and you have given us.' Then he said,\n«اقْبَلُوا الْبُشْرَى يَا أَهْلَ الْيَمَن»\n(Accept the glad tidings, O people of Yemen!) They said, `We accept. Therefore, inform us about the beginning of this matter and how it was.' He said,\n«كَانَ اللهُ قَبْلَ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ، وَكَانَ عَرْشُهُ عَلَى الْمَاءِ، وَكَتَبَ فِي اللَّوْحِ الْمَحْفُوظِ ذِكْرَ كُلِّ شَيْء»\n(Allah was before everything and His Throne was over the water. He then wrote in the Preserved Tablet mentioning everything.) Then a man came to me and said, \"O `Imran, your she camel has escaped from her fetter.\" I then went out after her and I do not know what was said after I left.\" This Hadith has been recorded in the Two Sahihs of Al-Bukhari and Muslim with a variety of wordings. In Sahih Muslim, it is recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«إِنَّ اللهَ قَدَّرَ مَقَادِيرَ الْخَلَائِقِ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَخْلُقَ السَّموَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ بِخَمْسِينَ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ وَكَانَ عَرْشُهُ عَلَى الْمَاء»\n(Verily Allah measured the amount of sustenance of the creatures fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth, and His Throne was over the water.) Under the explanation of this verse, Al-Bukhari recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«قَالَ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ: أَنْفِقْ أُنْفِقْ عَلَيْك»\n(Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, said, `Spend and I will spend on you.') And he said,\n«يَدُ اللهِ مَلْأَى لَا يَغِيضُهَا نَفَقَةٌ، سَحَّاءُ اللَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَار»\n(Allah's Hand is full, and it is not diminished by spending throughout the night and the day.) He also said,\n«أَفَرَأَيْتُمْ مَا أَنْفَقَ مُنْذُ خَلَقَ السَّموَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ فَإِنَّهُ لَمْ يَغِضْ مَا فِي يَمِينِهِ، وَكَانَ عَرْشُهُ عَلَى الْمَاءِ، وَبِيَدِهِ الْمِيزَانُ يَخْفِضُ وَيَرْفَع»\n(Have you seen what has been spent since the creation of the heavens and the earth Verily it does not diminish what is in His Right Hand (in the slightest) and His Throne was over the water. In His Hand is the Scale and he lowers and raises it.) Concerning Allah's statement,\nلِيَبْلُوَكُمْ أَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلاً\n(that He might try you, which of you is the best in deeds.) This means that He created the heavens and the earth for the benefit of His servants, whom He created so that they may worship Him and not associate anything with Him as a partner. Allah did not create this creation (of the heavens and the earth) out of mere frivolity. This is similar to His statement,\nوَمَا خَلَقْنَا السَّمَآءَ وَالاٌّرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا بَـطِلاً ذَلِكَ ظَنُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنَ النَّارِ\n(And We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them without purpose! That is the consideration of those who disbelieve! Then woe to those who disbelieve from the Fire!) 38: 27 Allah the Exalted, said,\nأَفَحَسِبْتُمْ أَنَّمَا خَلَقْنَـكُمْ عَبَثاً وَأَنَّكُمْ إِلَيْنَا لاَ تُرْجَعُونَ - فَتَعَـلَى اللَّهُ الْمَلِكُ الْحَقُّ لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ رَبُّ الْعَرْشِ الْكَرِيمِ\n(Did you think that We created you in play (without any purpose), and that you would not be brought back to Us So Exalted is Allah, the True King: there is no God but He, the Lord of the Supreme Throne!) 23:115-116 Allah, the Exalted, said,\nوَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالإِنسَ إِلاَّ لِيَعْبُدُونِ\n(And I (Allah) created not the Jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone).) 51:56 Concerning the statement of Allah,\nلِيَبْلُوَكُمْ\n(that He might try you,) It means so that He (Allah) may test you. Concerning the statement,\nأَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلاً\n(which of you is the best in deeds.) It is important to note here that Allah did not say, \"Which of you has done the most deeds.\" Rather, He said, \"Best in deeds.\" A deed cannot be considered a good deed until it is done sincerely for Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, and it must be in accordance with the legislation of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. Whenever a deed lacks one of these conditions, then it is null and void.\nThe Polytheists hasten their Torment by arguing against Resurrection after Death\nConcerning Allah's statement,\nوَلَئِن قُلْتَ إِنَّكُمْ مَّبْعُوثُونَ مِن بَعْدِ الْمَوْتِ\n(But if you were to say to them: \"You shall indeed be raised up after death.\") Allah, the Exalted, is saying, \"O Muhammad, if you were to inform these polytheists that Allah is going to resurrect them after their death, just as He created them originally (they would still reject).\" Even though they know that Allah, the Exalted, is the One Who created the heavens and the earth, just as He said,\nوَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَهُمْ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ\n(And if you ask them who created them, they will surely say: \"Allah.\")43:87 Allah says,\nوَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُمْ مَّنْ خَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ وَسَخَّرَ الشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ\n(And if you were to ask them: \"Who has created the heavens and the earth and subjected the sun and the moon\" They will surely reply: \"Allah.\") 29:61 Even after their awareness of this (Allah's creating), they still reject the resurrection and the promised return on the Day of Judgement. Yet, in reference to ability, the resurrection is easier (for Allah to perform) than the original creation. As Allah said,\nوَهُوَ الَّذِى يَبْدَأُ الْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ وَهُوَ أَهْوَنُ عَلَيْهِ\n(And He it is Who originates the creation, then He will repeat it (after it has perished); and this is easier for Him.) 30:27 Allah also said,\nمَّا خَلْقُكُمْ وَلاَ بَعْثُكُمْ إِلاَّ كَنَفْسٍ وَحِدَةٍ\n(The creation of you all and the resurrection of you all are only as (the creation and resurrection of) a single person.) 31:28 Concerning the statement,\nإِنْ هَـذَا إِلاَّ سِحْرٌ مُّبِينٌ\n(This is nothing but obvious magic.) The polytheists say this due to their disbelief and obstinacy. They say, \"We do not believe your claim that resurrection will occur.\" They also say, \"He (Muhammad) only says this (resurrection of the dead) because he is bewitched, and he wants you to follow him in what his bewitchment tells him. Concerning Allah's statement,\nوَلَئِنْ أَخَّرْنَا عَنْهُمُ الْعَذَابَ إِلَى أُمَّةٍ مَّعْدُودَةٍ\n(And if We delay the torment for them till a determined term,) Allah, the Exalted, is saying \"If We delay the torment and the destruction of these polytheists until an appointed time and a period determined, and We promise them a specific time period (of life), they would still say, in rejection and haste;\nمَا يَحْبِسُهُ\n(What keeps it back) They mean by this, \"What delays this torment from overtaking us\" Both rejection and doubt are their very nature. Therefore, they have no escape or refuge from the torment.\nThe Meanings of the Word Ummah\nThe word Ummah is used in the Qur'an and Sunnah with a number of different meanings. Sometimes when it is used it means a specified period of time. An example is the statement of Allah, the Exalted, in this verse,\nإِلَى أُمَّةٍ مَّعْدُودَةٍ\n(till a determined Ummah (term),) This is also the meaning in the statement of Allah in Surah Yusuf,\nوَقَالَ الَّذِى نَجَا مِنْهُمَا وَادَّكَرَ بَعْدَ أُمَّةٍ\n(Then the man who was released, now after Ummah (some time) remembered.) 12:45 The word Ummah is also used to refer to the Imam (leader) who is followed. An example of this is in the statement of Allah,\nإِنَّ إِبْرَهِيمَ كَانَ أُمَّةً قَـنِتًا لِلَّهِ حَنِيفًا وَلَمْ يَكُ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ\n(Verily, Ibrahim was an Ummah, obedient to Allah, Hanif, and he was not of those who were polytheists.) 16:120 The word Ummah is also used to mean religion and religious creed. This is as Allah mentions concerning the polytheists, that they said,\nإِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّقْتَدُونَ\n(Verily, we found our fathers following a certain way and religion, and we will indeed follow their footsteps. ) 43:23 The word Ummah is also used to mean a group (of people). This is as Allah says,\nوَلَمَّا وَرَدَ مَآءَ مَدْيَنَ وَجَدَ عَلَيْهِ أُمَّةً مِّنَ النَّاسِ يَسْقُونَ\n(And when he arrived at the water (well) of Madyan, he found there a group of men watering (their flocks).) 28:23 Allah also said,\nوَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِى كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولاً أَنِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُواْ الْطَّـغُوتَ\n(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah a Messenger (proclaiming): \"Worship Allah (Alone), and avoid Taghut.\") 16:36 Allah also said,\nوَلِكُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَّسُولٌ فَإِذَا جَآءَ رَسُولُهُمْ قُضِىَ بَيْنَهُمْ بِالْقِسْطِ وَهُمْ لاَ يُظْلَمُونَ\n(And for every Ummah there is a Messenger; when their Messenger comes, the matter will be judged between them with justice, and they will not be wronged.) 10:47 The meaning of Ummah here is those people who have had a Messenger sent among them. The meaning of Ummah in this context includes the believers and the disbelievers among them. This is like what has been recorded in Sahih Muslim,\n«وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَا يَسْمَعُ بِي أَحَدٌ مِنْ هَذِهِ الْأُمَّةِ يَهُودِيٌّ وَلَا نَصْرَانِيٌّ ثُمَّ لَا يُؤْمِنُ بِي إِلَّا دَخَلَ النَّار»\n(By He in Whose Hand is my soul! there is no one of this Ummah, whether he be a Jew or Christian, who hears of me and does not believe in me, except that he will enter the Hell- fire.) In reference to the Ummah of followers, then they are those who believe in the Messengers, as Allah said,\nكُنتُمْ خَيْرَ أُمَّةٍ أُخْرِجَتْ لِلنَّاسِ\n(You (the followers of Prophet Muhammad) are the best Ummah ever raised up for mankind.) 3:110 In the Sahih the Prophet said,\n«فَأَقُولُ: أُمَّتِي أُمَّتِي»\n(Then I will say, \"My Ummah (followers), my Ummah!\") The word Ummah is also used to mean a sect or party. An example of this usage is in the statement of Allah,\nوَمِن قَوْمِ مُوسَى أُمَّةٌ يَهْدُونَ بِالْحَقِّ وَبِهِ يَعْدِلُونَ\n(And of the people of Musa there is an Ummah who lead (the men) with truth and established justice therewith.) 7:159 Likewise is His statement,\nمِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ أُمَّةٌ قَآئِمَةٌ\n(A party of the People of the Scripture stand for the right.) 3:113","verse_meta": {"id": 1484},"text_arabic_simple": "وهو الذي خلق السماوات والارض في ستة ايام وكان عرشه على الماء ليبلوكم ايكم احسن عملا ولين قلت انكم مبعوثون من بعد الموت ليقولن الذين كفروا ان هاذا الا سحر مبين ٧ ولين اخرنا عنهم العذاب الى امة معدودة ليقولن ما يحبسه الا يوم ياتيهم ليس مصروفا عنهم وحاق بهم ما كانوا به يستهزيون ٨ ولين اذقنا الانسان منا رحمة ثم نزعناها منه انه لييوس كفور ٩ ولين اذقناه نعماء بعد ضراء مسته ليقولن ذهب السييات عني انه لفرح فخور ١٠ الا الذين صبروا وعملوا الصالحات اولايك لهم مغفرة واجر كبير ١١وَهُوَ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضَ فِى سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍۢ وَكَانَ عَرْشُهُۥ عَلَى ٱلْمَآءِ لِيَبْلُوَكُمْ أَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلًۭا ۗ وَلَئِن قُلْتَ إِنَّكُم مَّبْعُوثُونَ مِنۢ بَعْدِ ٱلْمَوْتِ لَيَقُولَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوٓا۟ إِنْ هَـٰذَآ إِلَّا سِحْرٌۭ مُّبِينٌۭ ٧ وَلَئِنْ أَخَّرْنَا عَنْهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابَ إِلَىٰٓ أُمَّةٍۢ مَّعْدُودَةٍۢ لَّيَقُولُنَّ مَا يَحْبِسُهُۥٓ ۗ أَلَا يَوْمَ يَأْتِيهِمْ لَيْسَ مَصْرُوفًا عَنْهُمْ وَحَاقَ بِهِم مَّا كَانُوا۟ بِهِۦ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ ٨ وَلَئِنْ أَذَقْنَا ٱلْإِنسَـٰنَ مِنَّا رَحْمَةًۭ ثُمَّ نَزَعْنَـٰهَا مِنْهُ إِنَّهُۥ لَيَـُٔوسٌۭ كَفُورٌۭ ٩ وَلَئِنْ أَذَقْنَـٰهُ نَعْمَآءَ بَعْدَ ضَرَّآءَ مَسَّتْهُ لَيَقُولَنَّ ذَهَبَ ٱلسَّيِّـَٔاتُ عَنِّىٓ ۚ إِنَّهُۥ لَفَرِحٌۭ فَخُورٌ ١٠ إِلَّا ٱلَّذِينَ صَبَرُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّـٰلِحَـٰتِ أُو۟لَـٰٓئِكَ لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةٌۭ وَأَجْرٌۭ كَبِيرٌۭ","text_arabic_uthmani": "وهو الذي خلق السماوات والارض في ستة ايام وكان عرشه على الماء ليبلوكم ايكم احسن عملا ولين قلت انكم مبعوثون من بعد الموت ليقولن الذين كفروا ان هاذا الا سحر مبين ٧ ولين اخرنا عنهم العذاب الى امة معدودة ليقولن ما يحبسه الا يوم ياتيهم ليس مصروفا عنهم وحاق بهم ما كانوا به يستهزيون ٨ ولين اذقنا الانسان منا رحمة ثم نزعناها منه انه لييوس كفور ٩ ولين اذقناه نعماء بعد ضراء مسته ليقولن ذهب السييات عني انه لفرح فخور ١٠ الا الذين صبروا وعملوا الصالحات اولايك لهم مغفرة واجر كبير","fetched_at": 1761763256.3660958}

This is just as Allah says about them, \nوَقَالُواْ مَا لِهَـذَا الرَّسُولِ يَأْكُلُ الطَّعَامَ وَيَمْشِى فِى الاٌّسْوَاقِ لَوْلا أُنزِلَ إِلَيْهِ مَلَكٌ فَيَكُونَ مَعَهُ نَذِيراً - أَوْ يُلْقَى إِلَيْهِ كَنْزٌ أَوْ تَكُونُ لَهُ جَنَّةٌ يَأْكُلُ مِنْهَا وَقَالَ الظَّـلِمُونَ إِن تَتَّبِعُونَ إِلاَّ رَجُلاً مَّسْحُوراً \n(And they say: \"Why does this Messenger eat food, and walk about in the markets. Why is not an angel sent down to him to be a warner with him\" Or; \"(why) has not a treasure been granted to him, or why has he not a garden whereof he may eat\" And the wrongdoers say: \"You follow none but a man bewitched.\") 25:7-8 Thus, Allah commanded His Messenger and guided him to not let these statements of theirs grieve his heart. Allah directed him to not let these statements prevent him, or deter him from calling them to Allah, both day and night. This is as Allah said, \nوَلَقَدْ نَعْلَمُ أَنَّكَ يَضِيقُ صَدْرُكَ بِمَا يَقُولُونَ \n(Indeed, We know that your breast is straitened at what they say.) 15:97 Allah says in this verse, \nفَلَعَلَّكَ تَارِكٌ بَعْضَ مَا يُوحَى إِلَيْكَ وَضَآئِقٌ بِهِ صَدْرُكَ أَن يَقُولُواْ\n(So perchance you may give up a part of what is revealed unto you, and that your breast feels straitened for it because they say...) The meaning here is that he (the Prophet ) may be compelled to give up the Message due to what they (the polytheists) say about him. However, Allah goes on to explain: \"You (Muhammad) are only a warner and you have an example in your brothers of the Messengers who came before you. For verily, the previous Messengers were rejected and harmed, yet they were patient until the help of Allah came to them.\"\nAn Explanation concerning the Miracle of the Qur'an\nThen Allah, the Exalted, explains the miracle of the Qur'an, and that no one is able to produce its like, or even bring ten chapters, or one chapter like it. The reason for this is that the Speech of the Lord of all that exists is not like the speech of the created beings, just as His attributes are not like the attributes of the creation. Nothing resembles His existence. Exalted is He, the Most Holy, and the Sublime. There is no deity worthy of worship except He and there is no true Lord other than He. Then Allah goes on to say, \nفَإِلَّمْ يَسْتَجِيبُواْ لَكُمْ\n(If then they answer you not,) Meaning, that if they do not come with a reply to that which you have challenged them with (to the reproduction of ten chapters like the Qur'an), then know that it is due to their inability to do so. Know (that this is a proof) that this is the speech revealed from Allah. It contains His knowledge, His commands and His prohibitions.

This is based upon their confession to Him that there is none worthy of worship except He. This is similar to Allah's statement,\nفَأَقِمْ وَجْهَكَ لِلدِّينِ حَنِيفاً فِطْرَةَ اللَّهِ الَّتِى فَطَرَ النَّاسَ عَلَيْهَا\n(So set you your face towards the religion, Hanifan. Allah's Fitrah with which He has created mankind.) 30:30, In the Two Sahihs it is recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,\n«كُلُّ مَوْلُودٍ يُولَدُ عَلَى الْفِطْرَةِ فَأَبَوَاهُ يُهَوِّدَانِهِ أَوْ يُنَصِّرَانِهِ أَوْ يُمَجِّسَانِهِ كَمَا تُولَدُ الْبَهِيمَةُ بَهِيمَةً جَمْعَاءَ هَلْ تُحِسُّونَ فِيهَا مِنْ جَدْعَاءَ؟»\n(Every child is born upon the Fitrah, but his parents make him a Jew, Christian, or Magian. This is just as the calf that is born whole. Have you noticed any calves that are born mutilated) In Sahih Muslim it is recorded that `Iyad bin Himar said that the Messenger of Allah said,\n«يَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالَى: إِنِّي خَلَقْتُ عِبَادِي حُنَفَاءَ فَجَاءَتْهُمُ الشَّيَاطِينُ فَاجْتَالَتْهُمْ عَنْ دِينهِمْ وَحَرَّمَتْ عَلَيْهِمْ مَا أَحْلَلْتُ لَهُمْ،وَأَمَرَتْهُمْ أَنْ يُشْرِكُوا بِي مَا لَمْ أُنْزِلْ بِهِ سُلْطَانًا»\n(Allah, the Exalted, says, `Verily, I created my servants Hunafa', but the devils came to them and distracted them from their religion. They made unlawful for them what I had made lawful for them and they commanded them to associate partners with Me, concerning which no authority has been revealed.) Therefore, the believer is one who remains upon this Fitrah. Concerning Allah's statement,\nوَيَتْلُوهُ شَاهِدٌ مِّنْهُ\n(and whom a witness from Him recites (follows) it;) This means that a witness comes to him from Allah. That witness is the pure, perfect and magnificent legislation that Allah revealed to the Prophets. These legislations were finalized with the legislation (Shari`ah) of Muhammad ﷺ. The believer has the natural disposition that bears witness to (the truth of) the general legislation, and accepts that specific laws are taken from the general legislation. The Fitrah accepts the Shari`ah and believes in it. For this reason Allah, the Exalted, says,\nأَفَمَن كَانَ عَلَى بَيِّنَةٍ مِّن رَّبِّهِ وَيَتْلُوهُ شَاهِدٌ مِّنْهُ\n(Can they who rely on a clear proof from their Lord, and whom a witness from Him recites (follows) it;) This clear proof which is recited is the Qur'an, which Jibril conveyed to the Prophet and the Prophet Muhammad conveyed it to his Ummah. Then Allah says,\nوَمِن قَبْلِهِ كِتَابُ مُوسَى\n(and before it, came the Book of Musa,) This means that before the Qur'an, there was the Book of Musa, the Tawrah.\nإَمَامًا وَرَحْمَةً\n(a guidance and a mercy) This means that Allah, the Exalted, revealed it to that Ummah as a leader for them and a guide for them to follow, as a mercy from Allah upon them. Therefore, whoever believed in it with true faith, then it would lead him to believe in the Qur'an as well. For this reason Allah said,\nأُوْلَـئِكَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِهِ\n(they believe therein) Then Allah, the Exalted, threatens those who reject the Qur'an, or any part of it, by saying,\nوَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِهِ مِنَ الاٌّحْزَابِ فَالنَّارُ مَوْعِدُهُ\n(but those of the sects that reject it, the Fire will be their promised meeting place.) This is directed towards everyone on the face of the earth who disbelieves in the Qur'an, whether they are idolators, disbelievers, People of the Scripture, or other sects from the descendants of Adam. This applies to all whom the Qur'an reaches, regardless of their differences in color, appearance, or nationality. As Allah says,\nلاٌّنذِرَكُمْ بِهِ وَمَن بَلَغَ\n(that I may therewith warn you and whomsoever it may reach. ) 6:19 Allah, the Exalted, said,\nقُلْ يَأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنِّى رَسُولُ اللَّهِ إِلَيْكُمْ جَمِيعًا\n(Say: \"O mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allah.\") Allah says,\nوَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِهِ مِنَ الاٌّحْزَابِ فَالنَّارُ مَوْعِدُهُ\n(but those of the sects that reject it, the Fire will be their promised meeting place.) In Sahih Muslim it is recorded that Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ  said,\n«وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَا يَسْمَعُ بِي أَحَدٌ مِنْ هَذِهِ الْأُمَّةِ يَهُودِيٌّ (أَوْ) نَصْرَانِيٌّ ثُمَّ لَا يُؤْمِنُ بِي إِلَّا دَخَلَ النَّار»\n(By He in Whose Hand is my soul! there is no one of this Ummah, whether he be a Jew or Christian, who hears of me and does not believe in me, except that he will enter the Hell- fire.)\nEvery Hadith is confirmed by the Qur'an\nAyyub As-Sakhtiyani reported from Sa`id bin Jubayr that he said, \"I did not hear any Hadith of the Prophet , substantiated as he stated it, except that I found its confirmation in the Qur'an. (The narrator said, \"Or he said, `I found its verification in the Qur'an.\"') Thus, it reached me that the Prophet said,\n«لَا يَسْمَعُ بِي أَحَدٌ مِنْ هَذِهِ الْأُمَّةِ يَهُودِيٌّ وَلَا نَصْرَانِيٌّ ثُمَّ لَا يُؤْمِنُ بِي إِلَّا دَخَلَ النَّار»\n(There is no one of this Ummah, whether he be a Jew or Christian, who hears of me and does not believe in me, except that he will enter the Hellfire.) Therefore, I said, `Where is its verification in the Book of Allah Most of what I have heard reported from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, I have found its verification in the Qur'an.' Then I found this verse,\nوَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِهِ مِنَ الاٌّحْزَابِ فَالنَّارُ مَوْعِدُهُ\n(but those of the sects that reject it (the Qur`an), the Fire will be their promised meeting place.) And this means from all religions.\" Then Allah says,\nفَلاَ تَكُ فِى مِرْيَةٍ مِّنْهُ إِنَّهُ الْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ\n(So be not in doubt about it. Verily, it is the truth from your Lord,) This means that the Qur'an is the truth from Allah and there is no doubt or suspicion concerning it. This is as Allah says,\nالم - ذَلِكَ الْكِتَابُ لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهِ هُدًى لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ\n(Alif Lam Mim. The revelations of the Book in which there is no doubt, is from the Lord of all that exists!)32:1-2 Allah, the Exalted, says,\nالم ذَلِكَ الْكِتَابُ لاَ رَيْبَ فِيهِ\n(Alif Lam Mim. This is the Book in which there is no doubt.) 2:1-2 The Ayah;\nوَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لاَ يُؤْمِنُونَ\n(but most of mankind believe not.) is similar to Allah's statement,\nوَمَآ أَكْثَرُ النَّاسِ وَلَوْ حَرَصْتَ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ\n(And most of mankind will not believe even if you desire it eagerly.)12:103 Likewise, Allah says,\nوَإِن تُطِعْ أَكْثَرَ مَن فِى الاٌّرْضِ يُضِلُّوكَ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ\n(And if you obey most of those on the earth, they will mislead you far away from Allah's path.) Allah also says,\nوَلَقَدْ صَدَّقَ عَلَيْهِمْ إِبْلِيسُ ظَنَّهُ فَاتَّبَعُوهُ إِلاَّ فَرِيقاً مِّنَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ\n(And indeed Iblis did prove true his thought about them: and they followed him, all except a group of true believers.)34:20","verse_meta": {"id": 1490},"text_arabic_simple": "افمن كان على بينة من ربه ويتلوه شاهد منه ومن قبله كتاب موسى اماما ورحمة اولايك يومنون به ومن يكفر به من الاحزاب فالنار موعده فلا تك في مرية منه انه الحق من ربك ولاكن اكثر الناس لا يومنون ١٧أَفَمَن كَانَ عَلَىٰ بَيِّنَةٍۢ مِّن رَّبِّهِۦ وَيَتْلُوهُ شَاهِدٌۭ مِّنْهُ وَمِن قَبْلِهِۦ كِتَـٰبُ مُوسَىٰٓ إِمَامًۭا وَرَحْمَةً ۚ أُو۟لَـٰٓئِكَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِهِۦ ۚ وَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِهِۦ مِنَ ٱلْأَحْزَابِ فَٱلنَّارُ مَوْعِدُهُۥ ۚ فَلَا تَكُ فِى مِرْيَةٍۢ مِّنْهُ ۚ إِنَّهُ ٱلْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكَ وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ ٱلنَّاسِ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ","text_arabic_uthmani": "افمن كان على بينة من ربه ويتلوه شاهد منه ومن قبله كتاب موسى اماما ورحمة اولايك يومنون به ومن يكفر به من الاحزاب فالنار موعده فلا تك في مرية منه انه الحق من ربك ولاكن اكثر الناس لا يومنون","fetched_at": 1761763264.003776}

This is just as Imam Ahmad recorded from Safwan bin Muhriz. Safwan said, \"I was holding the hand of Ibn `Umar when a man was brought to him. The man said, `How did you hear the Messenger of Allah ﷺ describe An-Najwa (secret counsel or confidential talk) on the Day of Resurrection' Ibn `Umar said, `I heard him say,\n«إِنَّ اللهَللهَعزَّ وَجَلَّ يُدْنِي الْمُؤْمِنَ فَيَضَعُ عَلَيْهِ كَنَفَهُ، وَيَسْتُرُهُ مِنَ النَّاسِ، وَيُقَرِّرُهُ بِذُنُوبِهِ وَيَقُولُ لَهُ: أَتَعْرِفُ ذَنْبَ كَذَا؟ أَتَعْرِفُ ذَنْبَ كَذَا؟ أَتَعْرِفُ ذَنْبَ كَذَا؟ حَتَّى إِذَا قَرَّرَهُ بِذُنُوبِهِ وَرَأَى فِي نَفْسِهِ أَنَّهُ قَدْ هَلَكَ قَالَ: فَإِنِّي قَدْ سَتَرْتُهَا عَلَيْكَ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَإِنِّي أَغْفِرُهَا لَكَ الْيَوْم»\n(Verily, Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, will draw near the believer and He will place His shade over him. He will conceal him from the people and make him confess to his sins. He will say to him, \"Do you recognize this sin Do you recognize that sin Do you recognize such and such sin\" This will continue until He makes him confess to all of his sins and he (the believer) will think to himself that he is about to be destroyed. Then Allah will say, \"Verily, I have concealed these sins for you in the worldly life and I have forgiven you for them today.\" Then he (the believer) will be given his Book of good deeds. As for the disbelievers and the hypocrites, the witnesses will say,)\nهَـؤُلاءِ الَّذِينَ كَذَبُواْ عَلَى رَبِّهِمْ أَلاَ لَعْنَةُ اللَّهِ عَلَى الظَّـلِمِينَ\n(These are the ones who lied against their Lord! No doubt! The curse of Allah is on the wrongdoers).\" Both Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded this narration in the Two Sahihs. Concerning Allah's statement,\nالَّذِينَ يَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَيَبْغُونَهَا عِوَجًا\n(Those who hinder (others) from the path of Allah, and seek a crookedness therein,) This means that they prevent the people from following the truth and traversing upon the path of guidance that leads to Allah, the Mighty and Sublime. In doing so they also keep the people away from Paradise itself. Allah's statement,\nوَيَبْغُونَهَا عِوَجًا\n(and seek a crookedness therein,) This means that they want their path to be crooked and uneven. Then, Allah's statement,\nوَهُمْ بِالاٌّخِرَةِ هُمْ كَـفِرُونَ\n(while they are disbelievers in the Hereafter.) This means that they deny the Hereafter and they reject the idea that any of its events will occur, or any of it exists at all. Concerning Allah's statement,\nأُولَـئِكَ لَمْ يَكُونُواْ مُعْجِزِينَ فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَمَا كَانَ لَهُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ مِنْ أَوْلِيَآءَ\n(By no means will they escape on earth, nor have they protectors besides Allah!) This means that these disbelievers are under the power of Allah and His force. They are in His grasp and are subject to His authority. He is Most Able to exact vengeance against them in this life before the coming of the Hereafter. This is like Allah's statement,\nإِنَّمَا يُؤَخِّرُهُمْ لِيَوْمٍ تَشْخَصُ فِيهِ الأَبْصَـرُ\n(but He gives them respite up to a Day when the eyes will stare in horror.)14:42 In the Two Sahihs it is recorded that the Prophet said,\n«إِنَّ اللهَ لَيُمْلِي لِلظَّالِمِ حَتَّى إِذَا أَخَذَهُ لَمْ يُفْلِتْه»\n(Verily Allah gives respite to the oppressor until He seizes him, then he will not be able to escape Him.) For this reason Allah says,\nيُضَاعَفُ لَهُمُ الْعَذَابُ\n(Their torment will be doubled!) This means that the torment will be doubled upon them, because Allah gave them hearing, vision and hearts, but these things did not benefit them. Rather, they were deaf from hearing the truth and blinded away from following it. This is just as Allah has mentioned concerning them when they enter into the Hellfire. Allah says,\nوَقَالُواْ لَوْ كُنَّا نَسْمَعُ أَوْ نَعْقِلُ مَا كُنَّا فِى أَصْحَـبِ السَّعِيرِ\n(And they will say: \"Had we but listened or used our intelligence, we would not have been among the dwellers of the blazing Fire!\") Allah also says,\nالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَصَدُّواْ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ زِدْنَـهُمْ عَذَابًا فَوْقَ الْعَذَابِ\n(Those who disbelieved and hinder (men) from the path of Allah, for them We will add torment to the torment.)16:88 For this reason they will be punished for every command that they abandoned and every prohibition that they indulged in. Then Allah continues by saying,\nأُوْلَـئِكَ الَّذِينَ خَسِرُواْ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَضَلَّ عَنْهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يَفْتَرُونَ\n(They are those who have lost their own selves, and that which they invented eluded them.) They lost themselves, meaning that they be made to enter a blazing Fire, where they will be punished, and its torment will not be lifted from them for even the blinking of an eye. This is as Allah said,\nكُلَّمَا خَبَتْ زِدْنَاهُمْ سَعِيرًا\n(Whenever it abates, We shall increase for them the fierceness of the Fire.)17:97 Concerning the statement,\nوَضَلَّ عَنْهُم\n(eluded them.) meaning that it has left them.\nمَّا كَانُواْ يَفْتَرُونَ\n(that which they invented) besides Allah, such as rivals and idols. Yet, these things did not avail them in the slightest. In fact, these things actually caused them great harm. This is as Allah says,\nوَإِذَا حُشِرَ النَّاسُ كَانُواْ لَهُمْ أَعْدَآءً وَكَانُواْ بِعِبَادَتِهِمْ كَـفِرِينَ\n(And when mankind are gathered, they will become their enemies and will deny their worshipping.)46:6 Allah says,\nإِذْ تَبَرَّأَ الَّذِينَ اتُّبِعُواْ مِنَ الَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُواْ وَرَأَوُاْ الْعَذَابَ وَتَقَطَّعَتْ بِهِمُ الاٌّسْبَابُ\n(When those who were followed disown those who followed (them), and they see the torment, then all their relations will be cut off from them.)2:166 Likewise, there are many other verses that prove this loss of theirs and their destruction. For this reason Allah says,\nلاَ جَرَمَ أَنَّهُمْ فِى الاٌّخِرَةِ هُمُ الاٌّخْسَرُونَ\n(Certainly, they are those who will be the greatest losers in the Hearafter.) 11:22 In this verse Allah informs about the direction of their end. He explains that they are the greatest losers among mankind in their transaction for the abode of the Hereafter. That is because they exchanged the highest levels (of Paradise) for the lowest levels (of Hell) and they substituted the pleasure of Gardens (of Paradise) for the fierce boiling water (of Hell). They exchanged the drink of sealed nectar with the fierce hot wind, boiling water, and a shade of black smoke. They chose food from the filth of dirty wounds instead of wide-eyed lovely maidens. They preferred Hawiyah (a pit in Hell) instead of lofty castles. They chose the anger of Allah and His punishment over nearness to Him and the blessing of gazing at Him. Therefore, it is no injustice that such people should be the greatest losers in the Hereafter.","verse_meta": {"id": 1491},"text_arabic_simple": "ومن اظلم ممن افترى على الله كذبا اولايك يعرضون على ربهم ويقول الاشهاد هاولاء الذين كذبوا على ربهم الا لعنة الله على الظالمين ١٨ الذين يصدون عن سبيل الله ويبغونها عوجا وهم بالاخرة هم كافرون ١٩ اولايك لم يكونوا معجزين في الارض وما كان لهم من دون الله من اولياء يضاعف لهم العذاب ما كانوا يستطيعون السمع وما كانوا يبصرون ٢٠ اولايك الذين خسروا انفسهم وضل عنهم ما كانوا يفترون ٢١ لا جرم انهم في الاخرة هم الاخسرون ٢٢وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ ٱفْتَرَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ كَذِبًا ۚ أُو۟لَـٰٓئِكَ يُعْرَضُونَ عَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ وَيَقُولُ ٱلْأَشْهَـٰدُ هَـٰٓؤُلَآءِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَبُوا۟ عَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ ۚ أَلَا لَعْنَةُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَى ٱلظَّـٰلِمِينَ ١٨ ٱلَّذِينَ يَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَيَبْغُونَهَا عِوَجًۭا وَهُم بِٱلْـَٔاخِرَةِ هُمْ كَـٰفِرُونَ ١٩ أُو۟لَـٰٓئِكَ لَمْ يَكُونُوا۟ مُعْجِزِينَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَمَا كَانَ لَهُم مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مِنْ أَوْلِيَآءَ ۘ يُضَـٰعَفُ لَهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ ۚ مَا كَانُوا۟ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ ٱلسَّمْعَ وَمَا كَانُوا۟ يُبْصِرُونَ ٢٠ أُو۟لَـٰٓئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ خَسِرُوٓا۟ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَضَلَّ عَنْهُم مَّا كَانُوا۟ يَفْتَرُونَ ٢١ لَا جَرَمَ أَنَّهُمْ فِى ٱلْـَٔاخِرَةِ هُمُ ٱلْأَخْسَرُونَ","text_arabic_uthmani": "ومن اظلم ممن افترى على الله كذبا اولايك يعرضون على ربهم ويقول الاشهاد هاولاء الذين كذبوا على ربهم الا لعنة الله على الظالمين ١٨ الذين يصدون عن سبيل الله ويبغونها عوجا وهم بالاخرة هم كافرون ١٩ اولايك لم يكونوا معجزين في الارض وما كان لهم من دون الله من اولياء يضاعف لهم العذاب ما كانوا يستطيعون السمع وما كانوا يبصرون ٢٠ اولايك الذين خسروا انفسهم وضل عنهم ما كانوا يفترون ٢١ لا جرم انهم في الاخرة هم الاخسرون","fetched_at": 1761763265.295831}

The man said, `How did you hear the Messenger of Allah ﷺ describe An-Najwa (secret counsel or confidential talk) on the Day of Resurrection' Ibn `Umar said, `I heard him say,\n«إِنَّ اللهَللهَعزَّ وَجَلَّ يُدْنِي الْمُؤْمِنَ فَيَضَعُ عَلَيْهِ كَنَفَهُ، وَيَسْتُرُهُ مِنَ النَّاسِ، وَيُقَرِّرُهُ بِذُنُوبِهِ وَيَقُولُ لَهُ: أَتَعْرِفُ ذَنْبَ كَذَا؟ أَتَعْرِفُ ذَنْبَ كَذَا؟ أَتَعْرِفُ ذَنْبَ كَذَا؟ حَتَّى إِذَا قَرَّرَهُ بِذُنُوبِهِ وَرَأَى فِي نَفْسِهِ أَنَّهُ قَدْ هَلَكَ قَالَ: فَإِنِّي قَدْ سَتَرْتُهَا عَلَيْكَ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَإِنِّي أَغْفِرُهَا لَكَ الْيَوْم»\n(Verily, Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, will draw near the believer and He will place His shade over him. He will conceal him from the people and make him confess to his sins. He will say to him, \"Do you recognize this sin Do you recognize that sin Do you recognize such and such sin\" This will continue until He makes him confess to all of his sins and he (the believer) will think to himself that he is about to be destroyed. Then Allah will say, \"Verily, I have concealed these sins for you in the worldly life and I have forgiven you for them today.\" Then he (the believer) will be given his Book of good deeds. As for the disbelievers and the hypocrites, the witnesses will say,)\nهَـؤُلاءِ الَّذِينَ كَذَبُواْ عَلَى رَبِّهِمْ أَلاَ لَعْنَةُ اللَّهِ عَلَى الظَّـلِمِينَ\n(These are the ones who lied against their Lord! No doubt! The curse of Allah is on the wrongdoers).\" Both Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded this narration in the Two Sahihs. Concerning Allah's statement,\nالَّذِينَ يَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَيَبْغُونَهَا عِوَجًا\n(Those who hinder (others) from the path of Allah, and seek a crookedness therein,) This means that they prevent the people from following the truth and traversing upon the path of guidance that leads to Allah, the Mighty and Sublime. In doing so they also keep the people away from Paradise itself. Allah's statement,\nوَيَبْغُونَهَا عِوَجًا\n(and seek a crookedness therein,) This means that they want their path to be crooked and uneven. Then, Allah's statement,\nوَهُمْ بِالاٌّخِرَةِ هُمْ كَـفِرُونَ\n(while they are disbelievers in the Hereafter.) This means that they deny the Hereafter and they reject the idea that any of its events will occur, or any of it exists at all. Concerning Allah's statement,\nأُولَـئِكَ لَمْ يَكُونُواْ مُعْجِزِينَ فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَمَا كَانَ لَهُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ مِنْ أَوْلِيَآءَ\n(By no means will they escape on earth, nor have they protectors besides Allah!) This means that these disbelievers are under the power of Allah and His force. They are in His grasp and are subject to His authority. He is Most Able to exact vengeance against them in this life before the coming of the Hereafter. This is like Allah's statement,\nإِنَّمَا يُؤَخِّرُهُمْ لِيَوْمٍ تَشْخَصُ فِيهِ الأَبْصَـرُ\n(but He gives them respite up to a Day when the eyes will stare in horror.)14:42 In the Two Sahihs it is recorded that the Prophet said,\n«إِنَّ اللهَ لَيُمْلِي لِلظَّالِمِ حَتَّى إِذَا أَخَذَهُ لَمْ يُفْلِتْه»\n(Verily Allah gives respite to the oppressor until He seizes him, then he will not be able to escape Him.) For this reason Allah says,\nيُضَاعَفُ لَهُمُ الْعَذَابُ\n(Their torment will be doubled!) This means that the torment will be doubled upon them, because Allah gave them hearing, vision and hearts, but these things did not benefit them. Rather, they were deaf from hearing the truth and blinded away from following it. This is just as Allah has mentioned concerning them when they enter into the Hellfire. Allah says,\nوَقَالُواْ لَوْ كُنَّا نَسْمَعُ أَوْ نَعْقِلُ مَا كُنَّا فِى أَصْحَـبِ السَّعِيرِ\n(And they will say: \"Had we but listened or used our intelligence, we would not have been among the dwellers of the blazing Fire!\") Allah also says,\nالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَصَدُّواْ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ زِدْنَـهُمْ عَذَابًا فَوْقَ الْعَذَابِ\n(Those who disbelieved and hinder (men) from the path of Allah, for them We will add torment to the torment.)16:88 For this reason they will be punished for every command that they abandoned and every prohibition that they indulged in. Then Allah continues by saying,\nأُوْلَـئِكَ الَّذِينَ خَسِرُواْ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَضَلَّ عَنْهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يَفْتَرُونَ\n(They are those who have lost their own selves, and that which they invented eluded them.) They lost themselves, meaning that they be made to enter a blazing Fire, where they will be punished, and its torment will not be lifted from them for even the blinking of an eye. This is as Allah said,\nكُلَّمَا خَبَتْ زِدْنَاهُمْ سَعِيرًا\n(Whenever it abates, We shall increase for them the fierceness of the Fire.)17:97 Concerning the statement,\nوَضَلَّ عَنْهُم\n(eluded them.) meaning that it has left them.\nمَّا كَانُواْ يَفْتَرُونَ\n(that which they invented) besides Allah, such as rivals and idols. Yet, these things did not avail them in the slightest. In fact, these things actually caused them great harm. This is as Allah says,\nوَإِذَا حُشِرَ النَّاسُ كَانُواْ لَهُمْ أَعْدَآءً وَكَانُواْ بِعِبَادَتِهِمْ كَـفِرِينَ\n(And when mankind are gathered, they will become their enemies and will deny their worshipping.)46:6 Allah says,\nإِذْ تَبَرَّأَ الَّذِينَ اتُّبِعُواْ مِنَ الَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُواْ وَرَأَوُاْ الْعَذَابَ وَتَقَطَّعَتْ بِهِمُ الاٌّسْبَابُ\n(When those who were followed disown those who followed (them), and they see the torment, then all their relations will be cut off from them.)2:166 Likewise, there are many other verses that prove this loss of theirs and their destruction. For this reason Allah says,\nلاَ جَرَمَ أَنَّهُمْ فِى الاٌّخِرَةِ هُمُ الاٌّخْسَرُونَ\n(Certainly, they are those who will be the greatest losers in the Hearafter.) 11:22 In this verse Allah informs about the direction of their end. He explains that they are the greatest losers among mankind in their transaction for the abode of the Hereafter. That is because they exchanged the highest levels (of Paradise) for the lowest levels (of Hell) and they substituted the pleasure of Gardens (of Paradise) for the fierce boiling water (of Hell). They exchanged the drink of sealed nectar with the fierce hot wind, boiling water, and a shade of black smoke. They chose food from the filth of dirty wounds instead of wide-eyed lovely maidens. They preferred Hawiyah (a pit in Hell) instead of lofty castles. They chose the anger of Allah and His punishment over nearness to Him and the blessing of gazing at Him. Therefore, it is no injustice that such people should be the greatest losers in the Hereafter.","verse_meta": {"id": 1493},"text_arabic_simple": "ومن اظلم ممن افترى على الله كذبا اولايك يعرضون على ربهم ويقول الاشهاد هاولاء الذين كذبوا على ربهم الا لعنة الله على الظالمين ١٨ الذين يصدون عن سبيل الله ويبغونها عوجا وهم بالاخرة هم كافرون ١٩ اولايك لم يكونوا معجزين في الارض وما كان لهم من دون الله من اولياء يضاعف لهم العذاب ما كانوا يستطيعون السمع وما كانوا يبصرون ٢٠ اولايك الذين خسروا انفسهم وضل عنهم ما كانوا يفترون ٢١ لا جرم انهم في الاخرة هم الاخسرون ٢٢وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ ٱفْتَرَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ كَذِبًا ۚ أُو۟لَـٰٓئِكَ يُعْرَضُونَ عَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ وَيَقُولُ ٱلْأَشْهَـٰدُ هَـٰٓؤُلَآءِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَبُوا۟ عَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ ۚ أَلَا لَعْنَةُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَى ٱلظَّـٰلِمِينَ ١٨ ٱلَّذِينَ يَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَيَبْغُونَهَا عِوَجًۭا وَهُم بِٱلْـَٔاخِرَةِ هُمْ كَـٰفِرُونَ ١٩ أُو۟لَـٰٓئِكَ لَمْ يَكُونُوا۟ مُعْجِزِينَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَمَا كَانَ لَهُم مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مِنْ أَوْلِيَآءَ ۘ يُضَـٰعَفُ لَهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ ۚ مَا كَانُوا۟ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ ٱلسَّمْعَ وَمَا كَانُوا۟ يُبْصِرُونَ ٢٠ أُو۟لَـٰٓئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ خَسِرُوٓا۟ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَضَلَّ عَنْهُم مَّا كَانُوا۟ يَفْتَرُونَ ٢١ لَا جَرَمَ أَنَّهُمْ فِى ٱلْـَٔاخِرَةِ هُمُ ٱلْأَخْسَرُونَ","text_arabic_uthmani": "ومن اظلم ممن افترى على الله كذبا اولايك يعرضون على ربهم ويقول الاشهاد هاولاء الذين كذبوا على ربهم الا لعنة الله على الظالمين ١٨ الذين يصدون عن سبيل الله ويبغونها عوجا وهم بالاخرة هم كافرون ١٩ اولايك لم يكونوا معجزين في الارض وما كان لهم من دون الله من اولياء يضاعف لهم العذاب ما كانوا يستطيعون السمع وما كانوا يبصرون ٢٠ اولايك الذين خسروا انفسهم وضل عنهم ما كانوا يفترون ٢١ لا جرم انهم في الاخرة هم الاخسرون","fetched_at": 1761763267.886374}

He will conceal him from the people and make him confess to his sins. He will say to him, \"Do you recognize this sin Do you recognize that sin Do you recognize such and such sin\" This will continue until He makes him confess to all of his sins and he (the believer) will think to himself that he is about to be destroyed. Then Allah will say, \"Verily, I have concealed these sins for you in the worldly life and I have forgiven you for them today.\" Then he (the believer) will be given his Book of good deeds. As for the disbelievers and the hypocrites, the witnesses will say,)\nهَـؤُلاءِ الَّذِينَ كَذَبُواْ عَلَى رَبِّهِمْ أَلاَ لَعْنَةُ اللَّهِ عَلَى الظَّـلِمِينَ\n(These are the ones who lied against their Lord! No doubt! The curse of Allah is on the wrongdoers).\" Both Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded this narration in the Two Sahihs. Concerning Allah's statement,\nالَّذِينَ يَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَيَبْغُونَهَا عِوَجًا\n(Those who hinder (others) from the path of Allah, and seek a crookedness therein,) This means that they prevent the people from following the truth and traversing upon the path of guidance that leads to Allah, the Mighty and Sublime. In doing so they also keep the people away from Paradise itself. Allah's statement,\nوَيَبْغُونَهَا عِوَجًا\n(and seek a crookedness therein,) This means that they want their path to be crooked and uneven. Then, Allah's statement,\nوَهُمْ بِالاٌّخِرَةِ هُمْ كَـفِرُونَ\n(while they are disbelievers in the Hereafter.) This means that they deny the Hereafter and they reject the idea that any of its events will occur, or any of it exists at all. Concerning Allah's statement,\nأُولَـئِكَ لَمْ يَكُونُواْ مُعْجِزِينَ فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَمَا كَانَ لَهُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ مِنْ أَوْلِيَآءَ\n(By no means will they escape on earth, nor have they protectors besides Allah!) This means that these disbelievers are under the power of Allah and His force. They are in His grasp and are subject to His authority. He is Most Able to exact vengeance against them in this life before the coming of the Hereafter. This is like Allah's statement,\nإِنَّمَا يُؤَخِّرُهُمْ لِيَوْمٍ تَشْخَصُ فِيهِ الأَبْصَـرُ\n(but He gives them respite up to a Day when the eyes will stare in horror.)14:42 In the Two Sahihs it is recorded that the Prophet said,\n«إِنَّ اللهَ لَيُمْلِي لِلظَّالِمِ حَتَّى إِذَا أَخَذَهُ لَمْ يُفْلِتْه»\n(Verily Allah gives respite to the oppressor until He seizes him, then he will not be able to escape Him.) For this reason Allah says,\nيُضَاعَفُ لَهُمُ الْعَذَابُ\n(Their torment will be doubled!) This means that the torment will be doubled upon them, because Allah gave them hearing, vision and hearts, but these things did not benefit them. Rather, they were deaf from hearing the truth and blinded away from following it. This is just as Allah has mentioned concerning them when they enter into the Hellfire. Allah says,\nوَقَالُواْ لَوْ كُنَّا نَسْمَعُ أَوْ نَعْقِلُ مَا كُنَّا فِى أَصْحَـبِ السَّعِيرِ\n(And they will say: \"Had we but listened or used our intelligence, we would not have been among the dwellers of the blazing Fire!\") Allah also says,\nالَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَصَدُّواْ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ زِدْنَـهُمْ عَذَابًا فَوْقَ الْعَذَابِ\n(Those who disbelieved and hinder (men) from the path of Allah, for them We will add torment to the torment.)16:88 For this reason they will be punished for every command that they abandoned and every prohibition that they indulged in. Then Allah continues by saying,\nأُوْلَـئِكَ الَّذِينَ خَسِرُواْ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَضَلَّ عَنْهُمْ مَّا كَانُواْ يَفْتَرُونَ\n(They are those who have lost their own selves, and that which they invented eluded them.) They lost themselves, meaning that they be made to enter a blazing Fire, where they will be punished, and its torment will not be lifted from them for even the blinking of an eye. This is as Allah said,\nكُلَّمَا خَبَتْ زِدْنَاهُمْ سَعِيرًا\n(Whenever it abates, We shall increase for them the fierceness of the Fire.)17:97 Concerning the statement,\nوَضَلَّ عَنْهُم\n(eluded them.) meaning that it has left them.\nمَّا كَانُواْ يَفْتَرُونَ\n(that which they invented) besides Allah, such as rivals and idols. Yet, these things did not avail them in the slightest. In fact, these things actually caused them great harm. This is as Allah says,\nوَإِذَا حُشِرَ النَّاسُ كَانُواْ لَهُمْ أَعْدَآءً وَكَانُواْ بِعِبَادَتِهِمْ كَـفِرِينَ\n(And when mankind are gathered, they will become their enemies and will deny their worshipping.)46:6 Allah says,\nإِذْ تَبَرَّأَ الَّذِينَ اتُّبِعُواْ مِنَ الَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُواْ وَرَأَوُاْ الْعَذَابَ وَتَقَطَّعَتْ بِهِمُ الاٌّسْبَابُ\n(When those who were followed disown those who followed (them), and they see the torment, then all their relations will be cut off from them.)2:166 Likewise, there are many other verses that prove this loss of theirs and their destruction. For this reason Allah says,\nلاَ جَرَمَ أَنَّهُمْ فِى الاٌّخِرَةِ هُمُ الاٌّخْسَرُونَ\n(Certainly, they are those who will be the greatest losers in the Hearafter.) 11:22 In this verse Allah informs about the direction of their end. He explains that they are the greatest losers among mankind in their transaction for the abode of the Hereafter. That is because they exchanged the highest levels (of Paradise) for the lowest levels (of Hell) and they substituted the pleasure of Gardens (of Paradise) for the fierce boiling water (of Hell). They exchanged the drink of sealed nectar with the fierce hot wind, boiling water, and a shade of black smoke. They chose food from the filth of dirty wounds instead of wide-eyed lovely maidens. They preferred Hawiyah (a pit in Hell) instead of lofty castles. They chose the anger of Allah and His punishment over nearness to Him and the blessing of gazing at Him. Therefore, it is no injustice that such people should be the greatest losers in the Hereafter.","verse_meta": {"id": 1495},"text_arabic_simple": "ومن اظلم ممن افترى على الله كذبا اولايك يعرضون على ربهم ويقول الاشهاد هاولاء الذين كذبوا على ربهم الا لعنة الله على الظالمين ١٨ الذين يصدون عن سبيل الله ويبغونها عوجا وهم بالاخرة هم كافرون ١٩ اولايك لم يكونوا معجزين في الارض وما كان لهم من دون الله من اولياء يضاعف لهم العذاب ما كانوا يستطيعون السمع وما كانوا يبصرون ٢٠ اولايك الذين خسروا انفسهم وضل عنهم ما كانوا يفترون ٢١ لا جرم انهم في الاخرة هم الاخسرون ٢٢وَمَنْ أَظْلَمُ مِمَّنِ ٱفْتَرَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ كَذِبًا ۚ أُو۟لَـٰٓئِكَ يُعْرَضُونَ عَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ وَيَقُولُ ٱلْأَشْهَـٰدُ هَـٰٓؤُلَآءِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَذَبُوا۟ عَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ ۚ أَلَا لَعْنَةُ ٱللَّهِ عَلَى ٱلظَّـٰلِمِينَ ١٨ ٱلَّذِينَ يَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَيَبْغُونَهَا عِوَجًۭا وَهُم بِٱلْـَٔاخِرَةِ هُمْ كَـٰفِرُونَ ١٩ أُو۟لَـٰٓئِكَ لَمْ يَكُونُوا۟ مُعْجِزِينَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ وَمَا كَانَ لَهُم مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مِنْ أَوْلِيَآءَ ۘ يُضَـٰعَفُ لَهُمُ ٱلْعَذَابُ ۚ مَا كَانُوا۟ يَسْتَطِيعُونَ ٱلسَّمْعَ وَمَا كَانُوا۟ يُبْصِرُونَ ٢٠ أُو۟لَـٰٓئِكَ ٱلَّذِينَ خَسِرُوٓا۟ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَضَلَّ عَنْهُم مَّا كَانُوا۟ يَفْتَرُونَ ٢١ لَا جَرَمَ أَنَّهُمْ فِى ٱلْـَٔاخِرَةِ هُمُ ٱلْأَخْسَرُونَ","text_arabic_uthmani": "ومن اظلم ممن افترى على الله كذبا اولايك يعرضون على ربهم ويقول الاشهاد هاولاء الذين كذبوا على ربهم الا لعنة الله على الظالمين ١٨ الذين يصدون عن سبيل الله ويبغونها عوجا وهم بالاخرة هم كافرون ١٩ اولايك لم يكونوا معجزين في الارض وما كان لهم من دون الله من اولياء يضاعف لهم العذاب ما كانوا يستطيعون السمع وما كانوا يبصرون ٢٠ اولايك الذين خسروا انفسهم وضل عنهم ما كانوا يفترون ٢١ لا جرم انهم في الاخرة هم الاخسرون","fetched_at": 1761763270.490539}

He was the first Messenger whom Allah sent to the people of the earth who were polytheists involved in worshipping idols. Allah mentions that he (Nuh) said to his people, \nإِنَّى لَكُمْ نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ\n(I have come to you as a plain warner.) meaning, to openly warn you against facing Allah's punishment if you continue worshipping other than Allah. Thus, Nuh said, \nأَن لاَّ تَعْبُدُواْ إِلاَّ اللَّهَ\n(That you worship none but Allah;) This can also be seen in his statement, \nإِنِّى أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ أَلِيمٍ\n(surely, I fear for you the torment of a painful Day.) This means, \"If you all continue doing this, then Allah will punish you with a severe punishment in the Hereafter.\" Then Allah says, \nفَقَالَ الْمَلأُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِن قِوْمِهِ\n(The chiefs who disbelieved among his people said;) The word `chiefs' (Al-Mala'u) here means the leaders and the heads of the disbelievers. They said, \nمَا نَرَاكَ إِلاَّ بَشَرًا مِّثْلَنَا\n(We see you but a man like ourselves,) This means, \"You are not an angel. You are only a human being, so how can revelation come to you over us We do not see anyone following you except the lowliest people among us, like the merchants, weavers and similar people. No people of nobility, or rulers among us follow you. These people who follow you are not known for their intelligence, wit, or sharp thinking. Rather, you merely invited them (to this Islam) and they responded to your call and followed you (ignorantly).\" This is the meaning of their statement, \nوَمَا نَرَاكَ اتَّبَعَكَ إِلاَّ الَّذِينَ هُمْ أَرَاذِلُنَا بَادِىَ الرَّأْى\n(nor do we see any follow you but the meanest among us and they (too) followed you without thinking.) The statement, \"without thinking,\" means that they merely followed the first thing that came to their minds. Concerning the statement, \nوَمَا نَرَى لَكُمْ عَلَيْنَا مِن فَضْلٍ\n(And we do not see in you any merit above us, in fact we think you are liars.) In this they are saying, \"We do not see that you and your followers have any virtuous status above us in your physical appearance, your character, your provisions, or your condition, since you accepted this (new) religion of yours.\" \nبَلْ نَظُنُّكُمْ كَـذِبِينَ\ns(in fact we think you are liars. ) This means, \"We think you are lying about that which you are claiming for yourselves of righteousness, piety, worship and happiness in the abode of the Hereafter when you arrive there.\" This was the response of the disbelievers to Nuh and his followers. This is a proof of their ignorance and their deficiency in knowledge and intelligence. For verily, the truth is not to be rejected because of the lowly status of those who follow it. Verily, the truth is correct in itself, regardless of whether its followers are of low status, or nobility. Actually, the reality concerning which there is no doubt, is that the followers of the truth are the noble ones, even though they may be poor. On the other hand, those who reject the truth are the lowly wretches, even though they may be wealthy. Thus, we see that usually the weakest of people are the ones who follow the truth, while the nobility and high-class people usually are opposed to the truth. This is as Allah says, \nوَكَذَلِكَ مَآ أَرْسَلْنَا مِن قَبْلِكَ فِى قَرْيَةٍ مِّن نَّذِيرٍ إِلاَّ قَالَ مُتْرَفُوهَآ إِنَّا وَجَدْنَآ ءَابَآءَنَا عَلَى أُمَّةٍ وَإِنَّا عَلَى ءَاثَـرِهِم مُّقْتَدُونَ \n(And similarly, We sent not a warner before you to any town (people) but the luxurious ones among them said: \"We found our fathers following a cerain way and religion, and we will indeed follow their footsteps.\")43:23 When Heraclius, the emperor of Rome, asked Abu Sufyan Sakhr bin Harb about the qualities of the Prophet , he said to him, \"Are his followers the noble people, or the weak\" Abu Sufyan said, \"They are the weakest of them.\" Then Heraclius said, \"They (weak ones) are the followers of the Messengers.\" Concerning their statement, \nبَادِىَ الرَّأْى\n(without thinking. ) In reality this is not objectionable, or something derogatory, because the truth when it is made clear, does not leave room for second-guessing, or excessive thinking. Rather, it is mandatory that it should be followed and this is the condition of every pious, intelligent person. No one continues doubtfully pondering the truth (after it is made clear) except one who is ignorant and excessively critical. The Messengers - Allah's peace and blessings be upon them all - only delivered what was obvious and clear. Concerning Allah's statement, \nوَمَا نَرَى لَكُمْ عَلَيْنَا مِن فَضْلٍ\n(And we do not see in you any merit above us,) They did not see this (the virtue of accepting Islam) because they were blind from the truth.

He was the first Messenger whom Allah sent to the people of the earth who were polytheists involved in worshipping idols. Allah mentions that he (Nuh) said to his people, \nإِنَّى لَكُمْ نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ\n(I have come to you as a plain warner.) meaning, to openly warn you against facing Allah's punishment if you continue worshipping other than Allah. Thus, Nuh said, \nأَن لاَّ تَعْبُدُواْ إِلاَّ اللَّهَ\n(That you worship none but Allah;) This can also be seen in his statement, \nإِنِّى أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ أَلِيمٍ\n(surely, I fear for you the torment of a painful Day.) This means, \"If you all continue doing this, then Allah will punish you with a severe punishment in the Hereafter.\" Then Allah says, \nفَقَالَ الْمَلأُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِن قِوْمِهِ\n(The chiefs who disbelieved among his people said;) The word `chiefs' (Al-Mala'u) here means the leaders and the heads of the disbelievers. They said, \nمَا نَرَاكَ إِلاَّ بَشَرًا مِّثْلَنَا\n(We see you but a man like ourselves,) This means, \"You are not an angel. You are only a human being, so how can revelation come to you over us We do not see anyone following you except the lowliest people among us, like the merchants, weavers and similar people. No people of nobility, or rulers among us follow you. These people who follow you are not known for their intelligence, wit, or sharp thinking. Rather, you merely invited them (to this Islam) and they responded to your call and followed you (ignorantly).\" This is the meaning of their statement, \nوَمَا نَرَاكَ اتَّبَعَكَ إِلاَّ الَّذِينَ هُمْ أَرَاذِلُنَا بَادِىَ الرَّأْى\n(nor do we see any follow you but the meanest among us and they (too) followed you without thinking.)

Concerning the statement, \nوَمَا نَرَى لَكُمْ عَلَيْنَا مِن فَضْلٍ\n(And we do not see in you any merit above us, in fact we think you are liars.) In this they are saying, \"We do not see that you and your followers have any virtuous status above us in your physical appearance, your character, your provisions, or your condition, since you accepted this (new) religion of yours.\" \nبَلْ نَظُنُّكُمْ كَـذِبِينَ\ns(in fact we think you are liars. ) This means, \"We think you are lying about that which you are claiming for yourselves of righteousness, piety, worship and happiness in the abode of the Hereafter when you arrive there.\" This was the response of the disbelievers to Nuh and his followers.

Actually, the reality concerning which there is no doubt, is that the followers of the truth are the noble ones, even though they may be poor. On the other hand, those who reject the truth are the lowly wretches, even though they may be wealthy. Thus, we see that usually the weakest of people are the ones who follow the truth, while the nobility and high-class people usually are opposed to the truth.

Muhammad bin Ishaq said, \"When Allah wanted to stop the flood, He sent a wind upon the face of the earth that caused the water to be still. Then the springs of the earth were closed off from the great flooding and the pouring (rain) from the sky halted. Allah, the Exalted, says, \nوَقِيلَ يَأَرْضُ ابْلَعِى مَآءَكِ\n(And it was said: \"O earth! Swallow up your water...\") 11:44 Thus, the water began decreasing and subsiding until the ship settled on Mount Judi. The People of the Tawrah (the Jews) claim that this occurred during the seventh month (of the year) and it lasted for seventeen nights. Then, on the first day of the tenth month, he (Nuh) saw the mountain tops. Then after forty more days, Nuh opened the small window in the roof of the ship and he sent a raven out to see what the water had done. However, the raven did not return to him. Then, he sent a pigeon out but it returned to him without finding any place (land) to put its two feet down. He extended his hand out of the ship and the pigeon grabbed his hand so that Nuh could pull it back into the ship. Then, after seven more days passed, he sent the pigeon out again to investigate for him. The pigeon returned in the evening with a leaf from an olive tree in its mouth. From this, Nuh knew that the water had decreased from the face of the earth. He remained in the ship for seven more days before he sent the pigeon out again. This time the pigeon did not return to him, so he knew that the earth had appeared. Thus, a year was completed from the time that Allah sent the flood, until the time of Nuh sending the pigeon. The first day of the first month of the second year began when the face of the earth appeared and land became visible. This is when Nuh uncovered the opening of the ship. During the second month of the second year, after twenty six nights, \nقِيلَ ينُوحُ اهْبِطْ بِسَلَـمٍ مِّنَّا\n(It was said: \"O Nuh!

Therefore, `Ad disbelieved in Hud and their disbelief was considered disbelief in all of the Messengers.\nوَاتَّبَعُواْ أَمْرَ كُلِّ جَبَّارٍ عَنِيدٍ\n(and followed the command of every proud, obstinate.) This means that they abandoned following their rightly guided Messenger and they followed the command of every proud, obstinate person. Thus, they were followed in this life by a curse from Allah and His believing servants whenever they are mentioned.

It has been said that the word \"the glad tidings\" means, \"Receive the glad tidings of Ishaq.\" Others have said that it means, \"The destruction of the people of Prophet Lut.\" The proof of the correctness of the first view is in Allah's statement, \nفَلَمَّا ذَهَبَ عَنْ إِبْرَهِيمَ الرَّوْعُ وَجَآءَتْهُ الْبُشْرَى يُجَـدِلُنَا فِى قَوْمِ لُوطٍ \n(Then when the fear had gone away from (the mind of) Ibrahim, and the glad tidings had reached him, he began to plead with Us for the people of Lut.)11:74 \nقَالُواْ سَلَـماً قَالَ سَلَـمٌ\n(They said: \"Salaman.\" He answered, \"Salamun.\") This means, \"Upon you.\" The scholars of explanation have said, \"Ibrahim's reply of `Salamun' was better than that with which they had greeted him with, because the subjective case (Salamun instead of Salaman) alludes to affirmation and eternity. \" \nفَمَا لَبِثَ أَن جَآءَ بِعِجْلٍ حَنِيذٍ\n(and he hastened to entertain them with a roasted calf.) This means that he (Ibrahim) left with haste in order to bring them food, as a host. The food that he brought was a calf. The word Hanidh means roasted upon heated stones. This meaning has been reported from Ibn `Abbas, Qatadah and others. This is as Allah has said in another verse, \nفَرَاغَ إِلَى أَهْلِهِ فَجَآءَ بِعِجْلٍ سَمِينٍ - فَقَرَّبَهُ إِلَيْهِمْ قَالَ أَلاَ تَأْكُلُونَ \n(Then he turned to his household, and brought out a roasted calf. And placed it before them (saying): \"Will you not eat\")51:26-27 This verse contains many aspects of the etiquettes of hosting guests. \nفَلَمَّا رَأَى أَيْدِيَهُمْ لاَ تَصِلُ إِلَيْهِ نَكِرَهُمْ\n(But when he saw their hands went not towards it (the meal), he mistrusted them,) This means that he felt estranged from them. \nوَأَوْجَسَ مِنْهُمْ خِيفَةً\n(and conceived a fear of them.) This is because angels are not concerned with food. They do not desire it, nor do they eat it. Therefore, when Ibrahim saw them reject the food that he had brought them, without tasting any of it at all, he felt a mistrust of them. \nوَأَوْجَسَ مِنْهُمْ خِيفَةً\n(and conceived a fear of them. ) As-Suddi said, \"When Allah sent the angels to the people of Lut, they set out walking in the form of young men, until they came to Ibrahim and they were hosted by him. When Ibrahim saw them, he rushed to host them. \nفَرَاغَ إِلَى أَهْلِهِ فَجَآءَ بِعِجْلٍ سَمِينٍ \n(Then he turned to his household, and brought out a roasted calf.)51:26 He slaughtered it (the calf), roasted it on hot stones and brought it to them. Then, he sat down with them. when he placed it before them. (saying): `Will you not eat' They said, `O Ibrahim! Verily, we do not eat food without a price.' Ibrahim then said, `Verily, this food has a price.' They said, `What is its price' He said, `You must mention the Name of Allah over it before eating it and praise Allah upon finishing it.' Jibril then looked at Mika'il and said, `This man has the right that his Lord should take him as an intimate friend.' \nفَلَمَّا رَأَى أَيْدِيَهُمْ لاَ تَصِلُ إِلَيْهِ نَكِرَهُمْ\n(But when he saw their hands went not towards it (the meal), he mistrusted them,) When Ibrahim saw that they were not eating, he became scared and frightened by them. Then, when Sarah looked and saw that he was honoring them, she began to serve them and she was laughing. She said, `What amazing guests we have. We serve them ourselves, showing them respect and they do not eat our food.\"' Then, concerning Allah's statement about the angels, \nقَالُواْ لاَ تَخَفْ\n(They said: \"Fear not,\") They were saying, \"Do not be afraid of us. Verily, we are angels sent to the people of Lut in order to destroy them.\" Then, Sarah laughed in delight of the good news of their destruction. This is because they had caused much corruption and their disbelief was severe. For this reason, she was rewarded with the glad tidings of a son, even after her despair. Concerning Allah's statement, \nوَمِن وَرَآءِ إِسْحَـقَ يَعْقُوبَ\n(and after Ishaq, of Ya`qub.) This means that the son that she was going to have would have a son (her grandson) who would succeed him and beget many children. For verily, Ya`qub was the son of Ishaq, just as Allah says in Surat Al-Baqarah, \nأَمْ كُنتُمْ شُهَدَآءَ إِذْ حَضَرَ يَعْقُوبَ الْمَوْتُ إِذْ قَالَ لِبَنِيهِ مَا تَعْبُدُونَ مِن بَعْدِى قَالُواْ نَعْبُدُ إِلَـهَكَ وَإِلَـهَ آبَآئِكَ إِبْرَهِيمَ وَإِسْمَـعِيلَ وَإِسْحَـقَ إِلَـهًا وَاحِدًا وَنَحْنُ لَهُ مُسْلِمُونَ \n(Or were you witnesses when death approached Ya'qub When he said unto his sons, \"What will you worship after me\" They said, \"We shall worship your God, the God of your fathers, Ibrahim, Isma`il, Ishaq, One God, and to him we submit.\") 2:133 From this point in this verse there is an evidence for those who say that Isma`il was the son of Ibrahim who was to be sacrificed. It could not have been Ishaq, because the glad tidings were given that he would have a son born to him named Ya`qub. So how could Ibrahim be commanded to sacrifice him when he was a small child and there had not been born to him a child yet, named Ya`qub, who was promised The promise of Allah is true and there is no breaking of Allah's promise. Therefore, it is not possible that Ibrahim was to sacrifice this child (Ishaq) with the condition being as it was. This makes it clear that Isma`il was the son that was to be sacrificed and this is the best, most correct and clearest evidence of that. And all praise is due to Allah. 9 \nقَالَتْ يوَيْلَتَا ءَأَلِدُ وَأَنَاْ عَجُوزٌ وَهَـذَا بَعْلِى شَيْخًا\n(She said (in astonishment): \"Woe unto me! Shall I bear a child while I am an old woman, and here is my husband an old man\") Allah speaks of her statement in this verse, just as He spoke of her action in another verse. \nفَأَقْبَلَتِ امْرَأَتُهُ فِى صَرَّةٍ فَصَكَّتْ وَجْهَهَا وَقَالَتْ عَجُوزٌ عَقِيمٌ \n(Then his wife came forward with a loud voice: she smote her face, and said: \"A barren old woman!\")51:29 This was the custom of the women in their speech and actions when they were expressing amazement. \nقَالُواْ أَتَعْجَبِينَ مِنْ أَمْرِ اللَّهِ\n(Then said: \"Do you wonder at the decree of Allah\") This means that the angels were saying to her, \"Do not be amazed at the command of Allah, for verily, whenever He wants something, He merely says `Be' and it is. So do not be amazed at this, even though you are old and barren and your husband is a very old man. Verily, Allah is able to do whatever He wills.\" \nرَحْمَتُ اللَّهِ وَبَرَكَـتُهُ عَلَيْكُمْ أَهْلَ الْبَيْتِ إِنَّهُ حَمِيدٌ مَّجِيدٌ\n(The mercy of Allah and His blessing be on you, O the family (of Ibrahim). Surely, He (Allah) is All-Praiseworthy, All-Glorious.) This means that He is the Most Praiseworthy in all of His actions and statements. He is praised and glorified in His Attributes and His Self. For this reason, it is confirmed in the two Sahihs that they (the Prophet's Companions) said, \"Verily, we already know how to greet you with Salam (peace), but how do we send Salah (prayer) upon you, O Messenger of Allah\" He said, \n«قُولُوا: اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ كَمَا صَلَّيْتَ عَلَى إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَآلِ إبْرَاهِيمَ، وَبَارِكْ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ كَمَا بَارَكْتَ عَلَى آلِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ إِنَّكَ حَمِيدٌ مَجِيد»\n(Say, \"O Allah, send prayers upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, just as You have sent prayers upon Ibrahim and the family of Ibrahim.

It could not have been Ishaq, because the glad tidings were given that he would have a son born to him named Ya`qub. So how could Ibrahim be commanded to sacrifice him when he was a small child and there had not been born to him a child yet, named Ya`qub, who was promised The promise of Allah is true and there is no breaking of Allah's promise. Therefore, it is not possible that Ibrahim was to sacrifice this child (Ishaq) with the condition being as it was. This makes it clear that Isma`il was the son that was to be sacrificed and this is the best, most correct and clearest evidence of that. And all praise is due to Allah. 9 \nقَالَتْ يوَيْلَتَا ءَأَلِدُ وَأَنَاْ عَجُوزٌ وَهَـذَا بَعْلِى شَيْخًا\n(She said (in astonishment): \"Woe unto me! Shall I bear a child while I am an old woman, and here is my husband an old man\") Allah speaks of her statement in this verse, just as He spoke of her action in another verse. \nفَأَقْبَلَتِ امْرَأَتُهُ فِى صَرَّةٍ فَصَكَّتْ وَجْهَهَا وَقَالَتْ عَجُوزٌ عَقِيمٌ \n(Then his wife came forward with a loud voice: she smote her face, and said: \"A barren old woman!\")51:29 This was the custom of the women in their speech and actions when they were expressing amazement. \nقَالُواْ أَتَعْجَبِينَ مِنْ أَمْرِ اللَّهِ\n(Then said: \"Do you wonder at the decree of Allah\") This means that the angels were saying to her, \"Do not be amazed at the command of Allah, for verily, whenever He wants something, He merely says `Be' and it is. So do not be amazed at this, even though you are old and barren and your husband is a very old man. Verily, Allah is able to do whatever He wills.\" \nرَحْمَتُ اللَّهِ وَبَرَكَـتُهُ عَلَيْكُمْ أَهْلَ الْبَيْتِ إِنَّهُ حَمِيدٌ مَّجِيدٌ\n(The mercy of Allah and His blessing be on you, O the family (of Ibrahim). Surely, He (Allah) is All-Praiseworthy, All-Glorious.) This means that He is the Most Praiseworthy in all of His actions and statements. He is praised and glorified in His Attributes and His Self. For this reason, it is confirmed in the two Sahihs that they (the Prophet's Companions) said, \"Verily, we already know how to greet you with Salam (peace), but how do we send Salah (prayer) upon you, O Messenger of Allah\" He said, \n«قُولُوا: اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ كَمَا صَلَّيْتَ عَلَى إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَآلِ إبْرَاهِيمَ، وَبَارِكْ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وَعَلَى آلِ مُحَمَّدٍ كَمَا بَارَكْتَ عَلَى آلِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ إِنَّكَ حَمِيدٌ مَجِيد»\n(Say, \"O Allah, send prayers upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, just as You have sent prayers upon Ibrahim and the family of Ibrahim.

It has been said that the word \"the glad tidings\" means, \"Receive the glad tidings of Ishaq.\" Others have said that it means, \"The destruction of the people of Prophet Lut.\" The proof of the correctness of the first view is in Allah's statement, \nفَلَمَّا ذَهَبَ عَنْ إِبْرَهِيمَ الرَّوْعُ وَجَآءَتْهُ الْبُشْرَى يُجَـدِلُنَا فِى قَوْمِ لُوطٍ \n(Then when the fear had gone away from (the mind of) Ibrahim, and the glad tidings had reached him, he began to plead with Us for the people of Lut.)11:74 \nقَالُواْ سَلَـماً قَالَ سَلَـمٌ\n(They said: \"Salaman.\" He answered, \"Salamun.\") This means, \"Upon you.\" The scholars of explanation have said, \"Ibrahim's reply of `Salamun' was better than that with which they had greeted him with, because the subjective case (Salamun instead of Salaman) alludes to affirmation and eternity. \" \nفَمَا لَبِثَ أَن جَآءَ بِعِجْلٍ حَنِيذٍ\n(and he hastened to entertain them with a roasted calf.) This means that he (Ibrahim) left with haste in order to bring them food, as a host. The food that he brought was a calf. The word Hanidh means roasted upon heated stones.

This is because angels are not concerned with food. They do not desire it, nor do they eat it. Therefore, when Ibrahim saw them reject the food that he had brought them, without tasting any of it at all, he felt a mistrust of them. \nوَأَوْجَسَ مِنْهُمْ خِيفَةً\n(and conceived a fear of them. ) As-Suddi said, \"When Allah sent the angels to the people of Lut, they set out walking in the form of young men, until they came to Ibrahim and they were hosted by him.

Ibrahim then said, `Verily, this food has a price.' They said, `What is its price' He said, `You must mention the Name of Allah over it before eating it and praise Allah upon finishing it.' Jibril then looked at Mika'il and said, `This man has the right that his Lord should take him as an intimate friend.' \nفَلَمَّا رَأَى أَيْدِيَهُمْ لاَ تَصِلُ إِلَيْهِ نَكِرَهُمْ\n(But when he saw their hands went not towards it (the meal), he mistrusted them,) When Ibrahim saw that they were not eating, he became scared and frightened by them.

We serve them ourselves, showing them respect and they do not eat our food.\"' Then, concerning Allah's statement about the angels, \nقَالُواْ لاَ تَخَفْ\n(They said: \"Fear not,\") They were saying, \"Do not be afraid of us. Verily, we are angels sent to the people of Lut in order to destroy them.\" Then, Sarah laughed in delight of the good news of their destruction.

After they informed Ibrahim of their mission to destroy the people of Lut, they left him and set out to destroy Lut's people that very night. After leaving Ibrahim, they came to Lut. Some say that they came to him while he was on a piece of land that belonged to him. Others say that they came to him while he was in his home. They approached him while they were in the most handsome of forms. They appeared in the forms of young men with handsome faces. This was a test from Allah that contained much wisdom and a firm evidence. Their appearance saddened him (Lut) and he felt grief in his soul because of them. He was afraid that if he did not host them as his guests, someone else of his people would host them and harm them. \nوَقَالَ هَـذَا يَوْمٌ عَصِيبٌ\n(He said: \"This is a distressful day.\") Ibn `Abbas and others said that this means, \"A severe test for him.\" This was because he knew that he would have to defend them and it would cause great problems for him. Qatadah said, \"They came to him while he was on a piece of land that belonged to him. They requested him to host them. He agreed, but he was shy of them and he walked in front of them. On the way to his home he said to them in attempt to convince them to go away, `By Allah, I do not know any people on the face of the earth more wicked and disgusting than these people of this town.' Then he walked on a little further. Then he repeated the same statement to them. He continued doing this until he had repeated the same thing four times.\" Then Qatadah said, \"They were ordered not to destroy them until their Prophet testified against them of this.\" Concerning Allah's statement, \nيُهْرَعُونَ إِلَيْهِ\n(rushing towards him.) meaning, they made haste and rushed due to their delight of this (new young men). Concerning the statement, \nوَمِن قَبْلُ كَانُواْ يَعْمَلُونَ السَّيِّئَاتِ\n(and since aforetime they used to commit crimes.) This means that this did not cease being their behavior until they were seized (by Allah's torment) and they were still in the same condition. \nقَالَ يقَوْمِ هَـؤُلاءِ بَنَاتِى هُنَّ أَطْهَرُ لَكُمْ\n(He said: \"O my people! Here are my daughters (the women of the nation), they are purer for you...\") This was his attempt to direct them to their women, for verily the Prophet is like a father for his nation. Therefore, he tries to guide them to that which is better for them in this life and the Hereafter. This is similar to his statement to them in another verse, \nأَتَأْتُونَ الذُّكْرَانَ مِنَ الْعَـلَمِينَ - وَتَذَرُونَ مَا خَلَقَ لَكُمْ رَبُّكُمْ مِّنْ أَزْوَجِكُمْ بَلْ أَنتُمْ قَوْمٌ عَادُونَ \n(Go you in unto the males of the nation, and leave those whom Allah has created for you to be your wives Nay, you are a trespassing people!)26:165-166 Allah said in another verse, \nقَالُواْ أَوَلَمْ نَنْهَكَ عَنِ الْعَـلَمِينَ \n(They (the people of the city) said: \"Did we not forbid you from entertaining any of the `Alamin\")15:70 This means, \"Didn't we forbid you from hosting men (male) guests\" \nقَالَ هَـؤُلآءِ بَنَاتِى إِن كُنْتُمْ فَـعِلِينَ - لَعَمْرُكَ إِنَّهُمْ لَفِى سَكْرَتِهِمْ يَعْمَهُونَ \n(Lut said: \"These (the girls of the nation) are my daughters, if you must act (so).\" Verily, by your life, in their wild intoxication, they were wandering blindly.)15:71-72 Then, Allah said, in this noble verse, \nهَـؤُلاءِ بَنَاتِى هُنَّ أَطْهَرُ لَكُمْ\n(Here are my daughters, they are purer for you.) Mujahid said, \"Actually, they were not his daughters, but they were from among his nation. Every Prophet is like a father to his nation.\" A similar statement has been reported from Qatadah and others.

This means, \"We only want males and you know that.

One of them would be speaking with some people when a stone would strike him from the sky and kill him while he was among the people. Thus, the stones followed them, striking the people in the entire land until they destroyed them all. Not a single one of them remained. Concerning Allah's statement, \nوَمَا هِى مِنَ الظَّـلِمِينَ بِبَعِيدٍ\n(and they are not ever far from the wrongdoers.) This means that this vengeance (of Allah) is not far from similar wrongdoers. Verily, it has been reported in a Hadith of the Sunan collections, from Ibn `Abbas, which he attributed to the Prophet , \n«مَنْ وَجَدْتُمُوهُ يَعْمَلُ عَمَلَ قَوْمِ لُوطٍ فَاقْتُلُوا الْفَاعِلَ وَالْمَفْعُولَ بِه»\n(Whoever you find doing the deed of Lut's people homosexuality, then kill the doer and the one who allows it to be done to him (both partners).)","verse_meta": {"id": 1556},"text_arabic_simple": "فلما جاء امرنا جعلنا عاليها سافلها وامطرنا عليها حجارة من سجيل منضود ٨٢ مسومة عند ربك وما هي من الظالمين ببعيد ٨٣فَلَمَّا جَآءَ أَمْرُنَا جَعَلْنَا عَـٰلِيَهَا سَافِلَهَا وَأَمْطَرْنَا عَلَيْهَا حِجَارَةًۭ مِّن سِجِّيلٍۢ مَّنضُودٍۢ ٨٢ مُّسَوَّمَةً عِندَ رَبِّكَ ۖ وَمَا هِىَ مِنَ ٱلظَّـٰلِمِينَ بِبَعِيدٍۢ","text_arabic_uthmani": "فلما جاء امرنا جعلنا عاليها سافلها وامطرنا عليها حجارة من سجيل منضود ٨٢ مسومة عند ربك وما هي من الظالمين ببعيد","fetched_at": 1761763349.056753}

This means that they followed his path, way and methodology in transgression. \nوَمَآ أَمْرُ فِرْعَوْنَ بِرَشِيدٍ\n(and the command of Fir`awn was no right guide.) This means there was no right guidance in it. It was only ignorance, misguidance, disbelief and stubbornness. Just as they followed him in this life and he was their leader and chief, likewise he will lead them to the Hellfire on the Day of Resurrection. He will lead them directly to it and they will drink from springs of destruction. Fir`awn will have a great share in that awful punishment. This is as Allah, the Exalted, said, \nفَعَصَى فِرْعَوْنُ الرَّسُولَ فَأَخَذْنَـهُ أَخْذاً وَبِيلاً \n(But Fir`awn disobeyed the Messenger; so We seized him with a severe punishment.)73:16 Allah also said, \nفَكَذَّبَ وَعَصَى - ثُمَّ أَدْبَرَ يَسْعَى - فَحَشَرَ فَنَادَى - فَقَالَ أَنَاْ رَبُّكُمُ الاٌّعْلَى - فَأَخَذَهُ اللَّهُ نَكَالَ الاٌّخِرَةِ وَالاٍّوْلَى - إِنَّ فِى ذَلِكَ لَعِبْرَةً لِّمَن يَخْشَى \n(But Fir`awn belied and disobeyed. Then he turned his back, striving (against Allah). Then he gathered (his people) and cried aloud, Saying: \"I am your lord, most high.\" So Allah, seized him with exemplary punishment for his last and first transgression. Verily, in this is an instructive admonition for whosoever fears Allah.)79:21-26 Allah also said, \nيَقْدُمُ قَوْمَهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ فَأَوْرَدَهُمُ النَّارَ وَبِئْسَ الْوِرْدُ الْمَوْرُودُ \n(He will go ahead of his people on the Day of Resurrection, and will lead them into the Fire, and evil indeed is the place to which they are led.) This will be the condition of those who were followed. They will have a great share of the punishment on the Day of Resurrection. This is as Allah says, \nلِكُلٍّ ضِعْفٌ وَلَـكِن لاَّ تَعْلَمُونَ\n(For each one there is double (torment), but you know not.) 7:38 Allah also says that the disbelievers will say while they are in the Hellfire, \nرَبَّنَآ إِنَّآ أَطَعْنَا سَادَتَنَا وَكُبَرَآءَنَا فَأَضَلُّونَا السَّبِيلاْرَبَّنَآ ءَاتِهِمْ ضِعْفَيْنِ مِنَ الْعَذَابِ\n(\"Our Lord! Verily, we obeyed our chiefs and our great ones, and they misled us from the (right) way. Our Lord! Give them double torment.\") 33:67-68 Concerning the statement, \nوَأُتْبِعُواْ فِى هَـذِهِ لَعْنَةً وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ\n(They were pursued by a curse in this (deceiving life of this world) and (so they will be pursued by a curse) on the Day of Resurrection. ) meaning, `We have made them to be followed by something more than the punishment of the Fire and that is their being cursed in this life.' \nوَيَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ بِئْسَ الرِّفْدُ الْمَرْفُودُ\n(and on the Day of Resurrection, evil is the gift granted.) Mujahid said, \"Another curse will be added to them on the Day of Resurrection, so these are two curses.\" `Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn `Abbas said, \nبِئْسَ الرِّفْدُ الْمَرْفُودُ\n(evil indeed is the gift granted.) \"The curse of this life and the Hereafter.\" Ad-Dahhak and Qatadah both said the same thing.

Rather, it is something that is dependent upon the will of Allah. Unto Him belongs the favor of immortality upon them. For this reason they are inspired to glorify and praise Him, just as they are inspired to breathe. Ad-Dahhak and Al-Hasan Al-Basri both said, \"It is about the right of the disobedient people of Tawhid who were in the Fire and then brought out of it.\" Then Allah finished this statement by saying,\nعَطَآءً غَيْرَ مَجْذُوذٍ\n(a gift without an end.) This means that it will never be cut off. This has been mentioned by Mujahid, Ibn `Abbas, Abu Al-`Aliyah and others. This has been mentioned so that the suspicious person will not doubt after the mention of the will of Allah. Someone may think that the mention of Allah's will here means that the pleasure of Paradise may end or change. To the contrary, it has been decreed that this pleasure will truly be forever and will never end. Likewise, Allah has clarified here that the eternal torment of the people of the Fire in Hell also is due to His will. He explains that He punishes them due to His justness and wisdom. This is why He says,\nإِنَّ رَبَّكَ فَعَّالٌ لِّمَا يُرِيدُ\n(Verily, your Lord is the doer of whatsoever He intends.) Similarly, Allah says,\nلاَ يُسْأَلُ عَمَّا يَفْعَلُ وَهُمْ يُسْـَلُونَ\n(He cannot be questioned as to what He does, while they will be questioned.)21:23 Here, Allah soothes the hearts and affirms the intent, by His saying,\nعَطَآءً غَيْرَ مَجْذُوذٍ\n(a gift without an end.) It has been recorded in the Two Sahihs that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«يُؤتَى بِالْمَوْتِ فِي صُورَةِ كَبْشٍ أَمْلَحَ فَيُذْبَحُ بَيْنَ الْجَنَّةِ وَالنَّارِ،ثُمَّ يُقَالُ: يَا أَهْلَ الْجَنَّةِ خُلُودٌ فَلَا مَوْتَ، وَيَا أَهْلَ النَّارِ خُلُودٌ فَلَا مَوْت»\n(Death will be brought in the form of a handsome ram (on the Day of Judgement) and it will be slaughtered between Paradise and the Hellfire. Then, it will be said, \"O people of Paradise! Eternity and no death! O people of Hellfire! Eternity and no death!\") In the Sahih it is recorded that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«فَيُقَالُ: يَا أَهْلَ الْجَنَّةِ إِنَّ لَكُمْ أَنْ تَعِيشُوا فَلَا تَمُوتُوا أَبَدًا، وَإِنَّ لَكُمْ أَنْ تَشِبُّوا فَلَا تَهْرَمُوا أَبَدًا، وَإِنَّ لَكُمْ أَنْ تَصِحُّوا فَلَا تَسْقَمُوا أَبَدًا، وَإِنَّ لَكُمْ أَنْ تَنْعَمُوا فَلَا تَبْأَسُوا أَبَدًا»\n(It will be said, `O people of Paradise, verily you will live and you will never die.

In one narration reported by Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others, Al-Hasan said, \"It means the morning prayer (Subh) and the late afternoon prayer (`Asr).\" Mujahid said, \"It is the morning prayer at the beginning of the day and the noon prayer (Zuhr) and late afternoon prayer (`Asr) at the end of the day.\" This was also said by Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi and Ad-Dahhak in one narration from him.\nوَزُلَفاً مِّنَ الَّيْلِ\n(and in some hours of the night.) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Al-Hasan and others said, \"This means the night prayer (`Isha').\" Ibn Al-Mubarak reported from Mubarak bin Fadalah that Al-Hasan said,\nوَزُلَفاً مِّنَ الَّيْلِ\n(and in some hours of the night.) \"This means the evening (Maghrib) and late night (`Isha') prayers. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«هُمَا زُلَفَا اللَّيْلِ: الْمَغْرِبُ وَالْعِشَاء»\n(They are the approach of the night: Maghrib and `Isha'.) The same was said by Mujahid, Muhammad bin Ka`b, Qatadah and Ad-Dahhak (that this means the Maghrib and `Isha' prayers). It should be noted that this verse was revealed before the five daily prayers were made obligatory during the night of Isra' (the Prophet's night journey to Jerusalem). At that time there were only two obligatory prayers: a prayer before sunrise and a prayer before sunset. During the late night another prayer (Tahajjud) was also made obligatory upon the Prophet and his nation. Later, this obligation was abrogated for his nation and remained obligatory upon him . Finally, this obligation was abrogated for the Prophet as well, according to one opinion. Allah knows best.\nThe Good Deeds wipe away the Evil Deeds\nConcerning Allah's statement,\nإِنَّ الْحَسَنَـتِ يُذْهِبْنَ السَّـيِّئَـتِ\n(Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds.) This is saying that the performance of good deeds is an expiation of previous sins. This has been mentioned in a Hadith recorded by Imam Ahmad and the Sunan Compilers, that the Commander of the faithful, `Ali bin Abi Talib, said, \"Whenever I used to hear a narration from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, Allah would cause me to benefit by it however He willed. If anyone informed me of any statement that he said, I would make him swear (by Allah) that the Prophet said it. If he swore by Allah, then I would believe him. Abu Bakr once told me -- and Abu Bakr was truthful -- that he heard the Messenger of Allah say,\n«مَا مِنْ مُسْلِمٍ يُذْنِبُ ذَنْبًا فَيَتَوَضَّأُ وَيُصَلِّي رَكْعَتَيْنِ إِلَّا غُفِرَ لَه»\n(There is not any Muslim who commits a sin, then he makes Wudu' and prays two units of prayer, except that he will be forgiven (that sin).) In the Two Sahihs it is recorded that the Commander of the faithful, `Uthman bin `Affan made Wudu' for the people (to see), just like the Wudu' of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. Then he said, \"I saw the Messenger of Allah ﷺ make Wudu' like this, and he said,\n«مَنْ تَوَضَّأَ وُضُوئِي هَذَا ثُمَّ صَلَّى رَكْعَتَيْنِ لَا يُحَدِّثُ فِيهِمَا نَفْسَهُ غُفِرَ لَهُ مَا تَقَدَّم مِنْ ذَنْبِه»\n(Whoever makes Wudu' like this Wudu' of mine, then he prays two units of prayer in which he does not speak to himself, he will be forgiven for his previous sins.) In the Sahih it is recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«أَرَأَيْتُمْ لَوْ أَنَّ بِبَابِ أَحَدِكُمْ نَهْرًا غَمْرًا، يَغْتَسِلُ فِيهِ كُلَّ يَوْمٍ خَمْسَ مَرَّاتٍ، هَلْ يُبْقِي مِنْ دَرَنِهِ شَيْئًا؟»\n(Do you think that if there was a flowing river at the door of anyone of you and he bathed in it five times every day, would there be any dirt left on him) They said, \"No, O Messenger of Allah!\" He () said;\n«كَذَلِكَ الصَّلَوَاتُ الْخَمْسُ يَمْحُو اللهُ بِهِنَّ الذُّنُوبَ وَالْخَطَايَا»\n(This is like the five daily prayers, for Allah uses them to wipe away the sins and wrongdoings.) Muslim recorded in his Sahih that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to say,\n«الصَّلَوَاتُ الْخَمْسُ، وَالْجُمُعَةُ إِلَى الْجُمُعَةِ، وَرَمَضَانُ إِلَى رَمَضَانَ، مُكَفِّرَاتٌ لِمَا بَيْنَهُنَّ مَا اجْتُنِبَتِ الْكَبَائِر»\n(The five daily prayers, Jumu`ah (Friday prayer) to Jumu`ah and (the fast of) Ramadan to Ramadan are expiations for whatever sins were committed between them, as long as you stay away from the major sins.) Al-Bukhari recorded Ibn Mas`ud saying that a man kissed a woman (who was not his relative or wife). He then came to the Prophet and informed him about the incident. Thus, Allah revealed,\nوَأَقِمِ الصَّلَوةَ طَرَفَىِ النَّهَارِ وَزُلَفاً مِّنَ الَّيْلِ إِنَّ الْحَسَنَـتِ يُذْهِبْنَ السَّـيِّئَـتِ\n(And perform Salah, at the two ends of the day and in some hours of the night. Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds.)11:114 The man then said, \"O Messenger of Allah, is this only for me\" The Prophet replied,\n«لِجَمِيعِ أُمَّتِي كُلِّهِم»\n(This is for all of my (Ummah) followers.) Al-Bukhari recorded this narration in the Book of Prayer as well and the Book of Tafsir. Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas said that a man came to `Umar and said that a woman came to do business with him. During the course of their business, he took her into his place and did everything with her except the actual act of sexual intercourse. `Umar said, \"Woe unto you! She probably was a woman whose husband is away (fighting) in the path of Allah.\" The man said, \"Of course she was.\" `Umar then said, \"Go to Abu Bakr and ask him about this.\" The man went to Abu Bakr and asked him about the matter. Abu Bakr said, \"She probably was a woman whose husband is away (fighting) in the path of Allah,\" just as `Umar had said. Then he went to the Prophet and told him the same story. The Prophet said,\n«فَلَعَلَّهَا مُغِيبَةٌ فِي سَبِيلِ الله»\n(She probably was a woman whose husband is away (fighting) in the path of Allah.) Then a verse of Qur'an was revealed,\nوَأَقِمِ الصَّلَوةَ طَرَفَىِ النَّهَارِ وَزُلَفاً مِّنَ الَّيْلِ إِنَّ الْحَسَنَـتِ يُذْهِبْنَ السَّـيِّئَـتِ\n(And perform the Salah, at the two ends of the day and in some hours of the night. Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds.) The man then said, \"O Messenger of Allah! Is this verse only for me, or does it apply to all of the people in general\" `Umar then struck the man on his chest with his hand and said, \"No, rather it is for all of the people in general.\" Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«صَدَقَ عُمَر»\n(`Umar has spoken the truth.)","verse_meta": {"id": 1587},"text_arabic_simple": "واقم الصلاة طرفي النهار وزلفا من الليل ان الحسنات يذهبن السييات ذالك ذكرى للذاكرين ١١٤ واصبر فان الله لا يضيع اجر المحسنين ١١٥وَأَقِمِ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ طَرَفَىِ ٱلنَّهَارِ وَزُلَفًۭا مِّنَ ٱلَّيْلِ ۚ إِنَّ ٱلْحَسَنَـٰتِ يُذْهِبْنَ ٱلسَّيِّـَٔاتِ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ ذِكْرَىٰ لِلذَّٰكِرِينَ ١١٤ وَٱصْبِرْ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يُضِيعُ أَجْرَ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ","text_arabic_uthmani": "واقم الصلاة طرفي النهار وزلفا من الليل ان الحسنات يذهبن السييات ذالك ذكرى للذاكرين ١١٤ واصبر فان الله لا يضيع اجر المحسنين","fetched_at": 1761763391.109191}

In one narration reported by Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others, Al-Hasan said, \"It means the morning prayer (Subh) and the late afternoon prayer (`Asr).\" Mujahid said, \"It is the morning prayer at the beginning of the day and the noon prayer (Zuhr) and late afternoon prayer (`Asr) at the end of the day.\" This was also said by Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi and Ad-Dahhak in one narration from him.\nوَزُلَفاً مِّنَ الَّيْلِ\n(and in some hours of the night.) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Al-Hasan and others said, \"This means the night prayer (`Isha').\" Ibn Al-Mubarak reported from Mubarak bin Fadalah that Al-Hasan said,\nوَزُلَفاً مِّنَ الَّيْلِ\n(and in some hours of the night.) \"This means the evening (Maghrib) and late night (`Isha') prayers. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«هُمَا زُلَفَا اللَّيْلِ: الْمَغْرِبُ وَالْعِشَاء»\n(They are the approach of the night: Maghrib and `Isha'.) The same was said by Mujahid, Muhammad bin Ka`b, Qatadah and Ad-Dahhak (that this means the Maghrib and `Isha' prayers). It should be noted that this verse was revealed before the five daily prayers were made obligatory during the night of Isra' (the Prophet's night journey to Jerusalem). At that time there were only two obligatory prayers: a prayer before sunrise and a prayer before sunset. During the late night another prayer (Tahajjud) was also made obligatory upon the Prophet and his nation. Later, this obligation was abrogated for his nation and remained obligatory upon him . Finally, this obligation was abrogated for the Prophet as well, according to one opinion. Allah knows best.\nThe Good Deeds wipe away the Evil Deeds\nConcerning Allah's statement,\nإِنَّ الْحَسَنَـتِ يُذْهِبْنَ السَّـيِّئَـتِ\n(Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds.) This is saying that the performance of good deeds is an expiation of previous sins. This has been mentioned in a Hadith recorded by Imam Ahmad and the Sunan Compilers, that the Commander of the faithful, `Ali bin Abi Talib, said, \"Whenever I used to hear a narration from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, Allah would cause me to benefit by it however He willed. If anyone informed me of any statement that he said, I would make him swear (by Allah) that the Prophet said it. If he swore by Allah, then I would believe him. Abu Bakr once told me -- and Abu Bakr was truthful -- that he heard the Messenger of Allah say,\n«مَا مِنْ مُسْلِمٍ يُذْنِبُ ذَنْبًا فَيَتَوَضَّأُ وَيُصَلِّي رَكْعَتَيْنِ إِلَّا غُفِرَ لَه»\n(There is not any Muslim who commits a sin, then he makes Wudu' and prays two units of prayer, except that he will be forgiven (that sin).) In the Two Sahihs it is recorded that the Commander of the faithful, `Uthman bin `Affan made Wudu' for the people (to see), just like the Wudu' of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. Then he said, \"I saw the Messenger of Allah ﷺ make Wudu' like this, and he said,\n«مَنْ تَوَضَّأَ وُضُوئِي هَذَا ثُمَّ صَلَّى رَكْعَتَيْنِ لَا يُحَدِّثُ فِيهِمَا نَفْسَهُ غُفِرَ لَهُ مَا تَقَدَّم مِنْ ذَنْبِه»\n(Whoever makes Wudu' like this Wudu' of mine, then he prays two units of prayer in which he does not speak to himself, he will be forgiven for his previous sins.)
