    "text": "<h2>Allah Warns the Idolators</h2><p>Sa`id bin Jubayr said that Ibn `Abbas said, \"When Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّن ذَا الَّذِى  يُقْرِضُ اللَّهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا فَيُضَاعِفَهُ لَهُ أَضْعَافًا كَثِيرَةً</div><p>(Who is he that will lend to Allah a goodly loan so that He may multiply it  to him many times) 2:245 was revealed, the Jews said, `O Muhammad! Has your  Lord become poor so that He asks His servants to give Him a loan' Allah sent  down, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّقَدْ سَمِعَ  اللَّهُ قَوْلَ الَّذِينَ قَالُواْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ فَقِيرٌ وَنَحْنُ  أَغْنِيَآءُ</div><p>(Indeed, Allah has heard the statement of those (Jews) who say: \"Truly, Allah  is poor and we are rich!\") 3:181.\" </p><p>This Hadith was collected by Ibn Marduwyah and Ibn Abi Hatim. </p><p>Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَنَكْتُبُ مَا  قَالُواْ</div><p>(We shall record what they have said) contains a threat and a warning that  Allah followed with His statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَتْلِهِمُ  الاٌّنْبِيَآءَ بِغَيْرِ حَقٍّ</div><p>(and their killing of the Prophets unjustly,) </p><p>This is what they say about Allah and this is how they treat His Messengers.  Allah will punish them for these deeds in the worst manner, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّقَدْ سَمِعَ  اللَّهُ قَوْلَ الَّذِينَ قَالُواْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ فَقِيرٌ وَنَحْنُ أَغْنِيَآءُ  سَنَكْتُبُ مَا قَالُواْ وَقَتْلَهُمُ الاٌّنبِيَاءَ بِغَيْرِ حَقٍّ وَنَقُولُ  ذُوقُواْ عَذَابَ الْحَرِيقِ - ذلِكَ بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْدِيكُمْ وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ  لَيْسَ بِظَلَّـمٍ لِّلْعَبِيدِ </div><p>(and We shall say: \"Taste you the torment of the burning (Fire).\" This is  because of that which your hands have sent before you. And certainly, Allah is  never unjust to (His) servants.) </p><p>They will be addressed like this as a way of chastising, criticism, disgrace  and humiliation. </p><p>Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِينَ قَالُواْ  إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَهِدَ إِلَيْنَا أَلاَّ نُؤْمِنَ لِرَسُولٍ حَتَّى يَأْتِيَنَا  بِقُرْبَانٍ تَأْكُلُهُ النَّارُ</div><p>(Those (Jews) who said: \"Verily, Allah has taken our promise not to believe  in any Messenger unless he brings to us an offering which the fire (from heaven)  shall devour.\") </p><p>Allah refuted their claim that in their Books, Allah took a covenant from  them to only believe in the Messenger whose miracles include fire coming down  from the sky that consumes the charity offered by a member of the Messenger's  nation, as Ibn `Abbas and Al-Hasan stated. Allah replied, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ قَدْ جَآءَكُمْ  رُسُلٌ مِّن قَبْلِى بِالْبَيِّنَـتِ</div><p>(Say: \"Verily, there came to you Messengers before me, with Al-Bayinat...\")  with proofs and evidence, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَبِالَّذِى  قُلْتُمْ</div><p>(and even with what you speak of) a fire that consumes the accepted charity,  as you asked, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلِمَ  قَتَلْتُمُوهُمْ</div><p>(why then did you kill them) Why did you meet these Prophets with denial,  defiance, stubbornness and even murder, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِن كُنتُمْ  صَـدِقِينَ</div><p>(if you are truthful), if you follow the truth and obey the Messengers. </p><p>Allah then comforts His Prophet Muhammad , </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِن كَذَّبُوكَ  فَقَدْ كُذِّبَ رُسُلٌ مِّن قَبْلِكَ جَآءُوا بِالْبَيِّنَـتِ وَالزُّبُرِ  وَالْكِتَـبِ الْمُنِيرِ </div><p>(Then if they reject you, so were Messengers rejected before you, who came  with Al-Baiyyinat and the Scripture, and the Book of Enlightenment.) meaning, do  not be sad because they deny you, for you have an example in the Messengers who  came before you. These Messengers were rejected although they brought clear  proofs, plain evidence and unequivocal signs, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالزُّبُرِ</div><p>(and the Zubur), the divinely revealed Books that were sent down to the  Messengers, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالْكِتَـبِ  الْمُنِيرِ</div><p>(and the Book of Enlightenment) meaning the clarification and best  explanation. </p>"
