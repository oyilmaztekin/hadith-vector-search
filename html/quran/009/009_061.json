Therefore, if we went to him and swore, he would believe us. Similar was reported from Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah. Allah said,</p><p>قُلْ أُذُنُ خَيْرٍ لَّكُمْ</p><p>(Say: \"He listens to what is best for you\"), he knows who's saying the truth and who is lying,</p><p>يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَيُؤْمِنُ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ</p><p>(he believes in Allah; has faith in the believers), he believes the believers,</p><p>وَرَحْمَةٌ لِّلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مِنكُمْ</p><p>(and is a mercy to those of you who believe\"), and a proof against the disbelievers,</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ يُؤْذُونَ رَسُولَ اللَّهِ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ</p><p>(But those who annoy Allah's Messenger, will have a painful torment.)</p>"
