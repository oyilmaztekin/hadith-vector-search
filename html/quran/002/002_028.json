Similarly, Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَمْ خُلِقُواْ مِنْ غَيْرِ شَىْءٍ أَمْ هُمُ الْخَـلِقُونَ - أَمْ خَلَقُواْ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ بَل لاَّ يُوقِنُونَ </div><p>(Were they created by nothing Or were they themselves the creators Or did they create the heavens and the earth Nay, but they have no firm belief) (52:35-36) and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَلْ أَتَى عَلَى الإِنسَـنِ حِينٌ مِّنَ الدَّهْرِ لَمْ يَكُن شَيْئاً مَّذْكُوراً </div><p>(Has there not been over man a period of time, when he was not a thing worth mentioning) (76:1). </p><p>There are many other Ayat on this subject. Ibn Jarir reported from `Ata' that Ibn `Abbas said that, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكُنتُمْ أَمْوَتًا فَأَحْيَـكُمْ</div><p>(Seeing that you were dead and He gave you life) means, \"You did not exist beforehand. You were nothing until Allah created you; He will bring death to you and then bring you back to life during Resurrection.\" Ibn `Abbas then said, \"This is similar to Allah's statement; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالُواْ رَبَّنَآ أَمَتَّنَا اثْنَتَيْنِ وَأَحْيَيْتَنَا اثْنَتَيْنِ</div><p>(They will say: \"Our Lord! You have made us to die twice and You have given us life twice.\") (40:11)\" </p>"
