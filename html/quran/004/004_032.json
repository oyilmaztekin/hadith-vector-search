    "text": "<h2>Do Not Wish for the Things Which Allah has Made Some Others to Excel In</h2><p>Imam Ahmad recorded that Umm Salamah said, \"O Messenger of Allah! Men go to battle, but we do not go to battle, and we earn one-half of the inheritance (that men get).\" Allah sent down,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَتَمَنَّوْاْ مَا فَضَّلَ اللَّهُ بِهِ بَعْضَكُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ</div><p>(And wish not for the things in which Allah has made some of you to excel others). At-Tirmidhi also recorded this Hadith. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِّلرِّجَالِ نَصِيبٌ مِّمَّا اكْتَسَبُواْ وَلِلنِّسَآءِ نَصِيبٌ مِّمَّا اكْتَسَبْنَ</div><p>(For men there is reward for what they have earned, (and likewise) for women there is reward for what they have earned,) indicates, according to Ibn Jarir, that each person will earn his wages for his works, a reward if his deeds are good, and punishment if his deeds are evil. It was also reported that this Ayah is talking about inheritance, indicating the fact that each person will get his due share of the inheritance, as Al-Walibi reported from Ibn `Abbas. Allah then directed the servants to what benefits them,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاسْأَلُواْ اللَّهَ مِن فَضْلِهِ</div><p>(and ask Allah of His Bounty.)Therefore, the Ayah states, \"Do not wish for what other people were endowed with over you, for this is a decision that will come to pass, and wishing does not change its decree. However, ask Me of My favor and I will grant it to you, for I Am Most Generous and Most Giving.\" Allah then said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيماً</div><p>(Surely, Allah is Ever All-Knower of everything.) meaning, Allah knows who deserves this life, and so He gives him riches, and whoever deserves poverty, He makes him poor. He also knows who deserves the Hereafter, and He directs him to perform the deeds that will help him to be sucessful in it, and whoever deserves failure, He prevents him from achieving righteousness and what leads to it. Hence, Allah said, m</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيماً</div><p>(Surely, Allah is Ever All-Knower of everything).</p>"
