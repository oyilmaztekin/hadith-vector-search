    "text": "<div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَى هَـذَا الْوَعْدُ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ </div><p>(And they say: \"When (will) this promise (be fulfilled), if you are truthful\")  Allah said, responding to them:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ</div><p>(Say) `O Muhammad,'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَسَى أَن يَكُونَ رَدِفَ لَكُم بَعْضُ الَّذِى تَسْتَعْجِلُونَ</div><p>(Perhaps that which you wish to hasten on, may be close behind you.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"That which you wish to hasten on has come close to you, or some of it has come close.\" This was also the view of Mujahid, Ad-Dahhak, `Ata Al-Khurasani, Qatadah and As-Suddi. This is also what is meant in the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَى هُوَ قُلْ عَسَى أَن يَكُونَ قَرِيبًا</div><p>(And they say: \"When will that be\" Say: \"Perhaps it is near!\") (17:51)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَسْتَعْجِلُونَكَ بِالْعَذَابِ وَإِنَّ جَهَنَّمَ لَمُحِيطَةٌ بِالْكَـفِرِينَ </div><p>(They ask you to hasten on the torment. And verily, Hell, of a surety, will encompass the disbelievers) (29:54).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَسَى أَن يَكُونَ رَدِفَ لَكُم</div><p>(may be close behind you.) means, it is being hastened for you. This was reported from Mujahid. Then Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَذُو فَضْلٍ عَلَى النَّاسِ</div><p>(Verily, your Lord is full of grace for mankind,) meaning, He abundantly bestows His blessings on them even though they wrong themselves, yet despite that they do not give thanks for those blessings, except for a few of them.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَيَعْلَمُ مَا تُكِنُّ صُدُورُهُمْ وَمَا يُعْلِنُونَ </div><p>(And verily, your Lord knows what their breasts conceal and what they reveal.) means, He knows what is hidden in their hearts just as He knows what is easily visible.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَوَآءٌ مِّنْكُمْ مَّنْ أَسَرَّ الْقَوْلَ وَمَنْ جَهَرَ بِهِ</div><p>(It is the same (to Him) whether any of you conceals his speech or declares it openly) (13:10),</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَعْلَمُ السِّرَّ وَأَخْفَى</div><p>(He knows the secret and that which is yet more hidden) (20: 7),</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلا حِينَ يَسْتَغْشُونَ ثِيَابَهُمْ يَعْلَمُ مَا يُسِرُّونَ وَمَا يُعْلِنُونَ</div><p>(Surely, even when they cover themselves with their garments, He knows what they conceal and what they reveal) (11:5). Then Allah tells us that He is the Knower of the unseen in the heavens and on earth, and that He is the Knower of the unseen and the seen, i.e., that which is unseen by His servants and that which they can see. And Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا مِنْ غَآئِبَةٍ</div><p>(and there is nothing hidden) Ibn `Abbas said, \"This means, there is nothing</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فِى السَّمَآءِ وَالاٌّرْضِ إِلاَّ فِى كِتَـبٍ مُّبِينٍ</div><p>(in the heaven and the earth but it is in a Clear Book.) This is like the Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَلَمْ تَعْلَمْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ يَعْلَمُ مَا فِى السَّمَآءِ وَالاٌّرْضِ إِنَّ ذلِكَ فِى كِتَـبٍ إِنَّ ذلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ </div><p>(Know you not that Allah knows all that is in the heaven and on the earth Verily, it is (all) in the Book. Verily, that is easy for Allah.) (22:70)</p>"
