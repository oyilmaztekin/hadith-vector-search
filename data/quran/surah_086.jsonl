Thus, the child is produced from both of them by the permission of Allah. Due to this Allah says,\nيَخْرُجُ مِن بَيْنِ الصُّلْبِ وَالتَّرَآئِبِ\n(Proceeding from between the backbone and the ribs.) meaning, the backbone (or loins) of the man and the ribs of the woman, which is referring to her chest.

Qatadah and others have said, \"The star has been named Tariq because it is only seen at night and it is hidden during the day.\" His view is supported by what has been mentioned in the authentic Hadith that prohibits a man to come to his family Taruq. This means that he comes to them unexpectedly at nighttime. Concerning Allah's statement,\nالثَّاقِبُ\n(Ath-Thaqib.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"The illuminating.\" `Ikrimah said, \"It is illuminating and it burns the Shaytan\" Then Allah says,\nإِن كُلُّ نَفْسٍ لَّمَّا عَلَيْهَا حَافِظٌ\n(There is no human being but has a protector over him.) meaning, every soul has a guardian over it from Allah that protects it from the calamities. This is as Allah says,\nلَهُ مُعَقِّبَـتٌ مِّن بَيْنِ يَدَيْهِ وَمِنْ خَلْفِهِ يَحْفَظُونَهُ مِنْ أَمْرِ اللَّهِ\n(For Him, there are angels in succession, before and behind him. They guard him by the command of Allah.) (13:11)\nHow Man is created is a Proof of Allah's Ability to Return Him to Him\nAllah says,\nفَلْيَنظُرِ الإِنسَـنُ مِمَّ خُلِقَ\n(So, let man see from what he is created!) This is alerting man to the weakness of his origin from which he was created. The intent of it is to guide man to accept (the reality of) the Hereafter, because whoever is able to begin the creation then he is also able to repeat it in the same way. This is as Allah says,\nوَهُوَ الَّذِى يَبْدَأُ الْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ وَهُوَ أَهْوَنُ عَلَيْهِ\n(And He it is Who originates the creation, then He will repeat it; and this is easier for Him.) (30:27) Then Allah says,\nخُلِقَ مِن مَّآءٍ دَافِقٍ\n(He is created from a water gushing forth.) meaning, the sexual fluid that comes out bursting forth from the man and the woman. Thus, the child is produced from both of them by the permission of Allah. Due to this Allah says,\nيَخْرُجُ مِن بَيْنِ الصُّلْبِ وَالتَّرَآئِبِ\n(Proceeding from between the backbone and the ribs.) meaning, the backbone (or loins) of the man and the ribs of the woman, which is referring to her chest. Shabib bin Bishr reported from `Ikrimah who narrated from Ibn `Abbas that he said,\nيَخْرُجُ مِن بَيْنِ الصُّلْبِ وَالتَّرَآئِبِ\n(Proceeding from between the backbone and the ribs.) \"The backbone of the man and the ribs of the woman. It (the fluid) is yellow and fine in texture. The child will not be born except from both of them (i.e., their sexual fluids).\" Concerning Allah's statement,\nإِنَّهُ عَلَى رَجْعِهِ لَقَادِرٌ\n(Verily, He is Able to bring him back (to life)!) This means that He is able to return this man that is created from fluid gushed forth. In other words, He is able to repeat his creation and resurrect him to the final abode. This is clearly possible, because whoever is able to begin the creation then he surely is able to repeat it. Indeed Allah has mentioned this proof in more than one place in the Qur'an.\nOn the Day of Judgement, Man will have no Power or Assistance\nIn this regard Allah says,\nيَوْمَ تُبْلَى السَّرَآئِرُ\n(The Day when all the secrets will be examined.) meaning, on the Day of Judgement the secrets will be tested. This means that they will be exposed and made manifest. Thus, the secret will be made open and that which is concealed will be well known. It is confirmed in the Two Sahihs on the authority of Ibn `Umar that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«يُرْفَعُ لِكُلِّ غَادِرٍ لِوَاءٌ عِنْدَ اسْتِهِ يُقَالُ: هذِهِ غَدْرَةُ فُلَانِ بْنِ فُلَان»\n(Every betrayer will have a flag raised for him behind his back, and it will be said, `This is the betrayal of so-and-so, the son of so-and-so.')
