    "text": "<h2>Al-Birr is Spending from the Best of One's Wealth</h2><p>In his Tafsir, Waki` reported, that `Amr bin Maymun said that</p><p>لَن تَنَالُواْ الْبِرَّ</p><p>(By no means shall you attain Al-Birr) is in reference to attaining Paradise.</p><p>Imam Ahmad reported that Anas bin Malik said, \"Abu Talhah had more property than any other among the Ansar in Al-Madinah, and the most beloved of his property to him was Bayruha' garden, which was in front of the (Messenger's) Masjid. Sometimes, Allah's Messenger ﷺ used to go to the garden and drink its fresh water.\" Anas added, \"When these verses were revealed,</p><p>لَن تَنَالُواْ الْبِرَّ حَتَّى تُنفِقُواْ مِمَّا تُحِبُّونَ</p><p>(By no means shall you attain Al-Birr unless You spend of that which you love,)</p><p>Abu Talhah said, `O Allah's Messenger! Allah says,</p><p>لَن تَنَالُواْ الْبِرَّ حَتَّى تُنفِقُواْ مِمَّا تُحِبُّونَ</p><p>(By no means shall you attain Al-Birr, unless you spend of that which you love;) No doubt, Bayruha' garden is the most beloved of all my property to me. So I want to give it in charity in Allah's cause, and I expect its reward and compensation from Allah. O Allah's Messenger! Spend it where Allah makes you think is feasible. ' On that, Allah's Messenger ﷺ said,</p><p>«بَخٍ بَخٍ، ذَاكَ مَالٌ رَابِحٌ، ذَاكَ مَالٌ رَابِحٌ، وَقَدْ سَمِعْتُ، وَأَنَا أَرَى أَنْ تَجْعَلَهَا فِي الْأَقْرَبِين»</p><p>(Well-done! It is profitable property, it is profitable property. I have heard what you have said, and I think it would be proper if you gave it to your kith and kin.)</p><p>Abu Talhah said, `I will do so, O Allah's Messenger.' Then Abu Talhah distributed that garden among his relatives and cousins.\"</p><p>This Hadith was recorded in the Two Sahihs. They also recorded that `Umar said, \"O Messenger of Allah! I never gained possession of a piece of property more precious to me than my share in Khaybar. Therefore, what do you command me to do with it\" The Prophet said,</p><p>«حَبِّسِ الْأَصْلَ وَسَبِّلِ الثَّمَرَة»</p><p>(Retain the land to give its fruits in Allah's cause.)</p>"
