    "text": "<h2>Guidance and Misguidance are in the Hands of Allah</h2><p>Allah tells us how He deals with His creation and how His rulings are carried out. He tells us that there is none who can put back His judgement, for whomever He guides cannot be led astray,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن يُضْلِلْ فَلَن تَجِدَ لَهُمْ أَوْلِيَآءَ مِن دُونِهِ</div><p>(and whomever He leaves astray can never find helpers other than Him)to guide him. As Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَن يَهْدِ اللَّهُ فَهُوَ الْمُهْتَدِ وَمَن يُضْلِلْ فَلَن تَجِدَ لَهُ وَلِيًّا مُّرْشِدًا</div><p>(He whom Allah guides, he is the rightly-guided; but he whom He sends astray, for him you will find no Wali (guiding friend) to lead him) 18:17</p><h2>The Punishment of the People of Misguidance</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنَحْشُرُهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ</div><p>(and We shall gather them together on the Day of Resurrection on their faces,) Imam Ahmad recorded from Anas bin Malik that the Prophet was asked, \"O Messenger of Allah, how will the people be gathered on their faces\" He said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«الَّذِي أَمْشَاهُمْ عَلَى أَرْجُلِهِمْ قَادِرٌ عَلَى أَنْ يُمْشِيَهُمْ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِم»</div><p>(The One Who made them walk on their feet is able to make them walk on their faces.) It was also reported (by Al-Bukhari and Muslim) in the Two Sahihs.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عُمْيًا</div><p>(blind) means, unable to see.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَبُكْمًا</div><p>(dumb) means, unable to speak.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَصُمًّا</div><p>(deaf) means, unable to hear. They will be in this state as a punishment for the way they were in this world, blind, dumb and deaf to the truth. This will be their recompense when they are gathered on the Day of Resurrection, at the time when they need these faculties most of all.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَأْوَاهُمُ</div><p>(their abode) means, their destination.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">جَهَنَّمُ كُلَّمَا خَبَتْ</div><p>(will be Hell; whenever it abates,) Ibn `Abbas said, \"(This means) calms down,\" Mujahid said, (It means) is extinguished,\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">زِدْنَاهُمْ سَعِيرًا</div><p>(We shall increase for them the fierceness of the Fire.) meaning, increasing its flames and heat and coals, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَذُوقُواْ فَلَن نَّزِيدَكُمْ إِلاَّ عَذَاباً </div><p>(So taste you (the results of your evil actions). No increase shall We give you, except in torment.) (78:30)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذَلِكَ جَزَآؤُهُم بِأَنَّهُمْ كَفَرُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا وَقَالُواْ أَءِذَا كُنَّا عِظَامًا وَرُفَاتًا أَءِنَّا لَمَبْعُوثُونَ خَلْقًا جَدِيدًا </div>"
