(54:50) Allah also says,\n\n\nوَمَآ أَمْرُ السَّاعَةِ إِلاَّ كَلَمْحِ الْبَصَرِ أَوْ هُوَ أَقْرَبُ\n\n\n(And the matter of the Hour is not but as a twinkling of the eye, or even nearer.) (16:77) Allah then says,\n\n\nفَإِذَا هُم بِالسَّاهِرَةِ\n\n\n(When behold, they are at As-Sahirah.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"As-Sahirah means the entire earth.\" Sa`id bin Jubayr, Qatadah and Abu Salih have all said this as well. `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Ad-Dahhak, and Ibn Zayd have all said, \"As-Sahirah means the face of the earth.\" Mujahid said, \"They will be at its (the earth's) lowest part, and they will be brought out to highest part.\" Then he said, \"As-Sahirah is a level place.\" Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said,\n\n\nفَإِذَا هُم بِالسَّاهِرَةِ\n\n\n(When behold, they are at As-Sahirah.) \"Allah says,\n\n\nيَوْمَ تُبَدَّلُ الاٌّرْضُ غَيْرَ الاٌّرْضِ وَالسَّمَـوَتُ وَبَرَزُواْ للَّهِ الْوَاحِدِ الْقَهَّارِ\n\n\n(On the Day when the earth will be changed to another earth and so will be the heavens, and they will appear before Allah, the One, the Irresistible.)

There are those people whose souls the angels remove with ease, as if they were unraveling him (i.e., his soul from him) due to their briskness. This is the meaning of Allah's statement,\n\n\nوَالنَّـشِطَـتِ نَشْطاً\n\n\n(By those who free briskly.) This has been mentioned by Ibn `Abbas. In reference to Allah's statement,\n\n\nوَالسَّـبِحَـتِ سَبْحاً\n\n\n(And by the swimmers, swimming.) Ibn Mas`ud said, \"They are the angels.\" Similar statements have been reported from `Ali, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, and Abu Salih. Concerning Allah's statement,\n\n\nفَالسَّـبِقَـتِ سَبْقاً\n\n\n(And by the racers, racing.) It has been narrated from `Ali, Masruq, Mujahid, Abu Salih, and Al-Hasan Al-Basri that this means the angels. Then Allah says,\n\n\nفَالْمُدَبِّرَتِ أَمْراً\n\n\n(And by those who arrange affairs.) `Ali, Mujahid, `Ata', Abu Salih, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, and As-Suddi all said, \"They are the angels.\" Al-Hasan added, \"They control the affairs from the heaven to the earth, meaning by the command of their Lord, the Mighty and Majestic.\"\n\n\nThe Description of the Day of Judgement, the People, and what They will say\n\n\nThen Allah says,\n\n\nيَوْمَ تَرْجُفُ الرَّاجِفَةُ - تَتْبَعُهَا الرَّادِفَةُ\n\n\n(On the Day the Rajifah shakes, followed by the Radifah.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"These are the two blasts (of the Trumpet) -- the first and the second.\" Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and others have made similar statements. It has been reported from Mujahid that he said, \"In reference to the first, it is the statement of Allah,\n\n\nيَوْمَ تَرْجُفُ الرَّاجِفَةُ\n\n\n(On the Day the Rajifah shakes,) This is similar to Allah's statement,\n\n\nيَوْمَ تَرْجُفُ الاٌّرْضُ وَالْجِبَالُ\n\n\n(On the Day the earth and the mountains shake.) (73:14) The second is Ar-Radifah, and it is like the Allah's statement,\n\n\nوَحُمِلَتِ الاٌّرْضُ وَالْجِبَالُ فَدُكَّتَا دَكَّةً وَحِدَةً\n\n\n(And the earth and mountains shall be removed from their places, and crushed with a single crushing.) (69:14)\" Concerning Allah's statement,\n\n\nقُلُوبٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ وَاجِفَةٌ\n\n\n(Hearts that Day will tremble.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"This means afraid.\" Mujahid and Qatadah also said this.\n\n\nأَبْصَـرُهَا خَـشِعَةٌ\n\n\n(Their vision humiliated.) meaning, the eyes of the people. It means that the eyes will be lowly and disgraced from what they will witness of terrors. Allah then says,\n\n\nيَقُولُونَ أَءِنَّا لَمَرْدُودُونَ فِى الْحَـفِرَةِ\n\n\n(They say: \"Shall we indeed be brought back from Al-Hafirah\") meaning, the idolators of the Quraysh and whoever rejects the Hereafter as they did. They consider the occurrence of the resurrection after being placed in Al-Hafirah -- which are the graves -- as something farfetched. This has been said by Mujahid. They feel that this is something impossible after the destruction of their physical bodies and the disintegration of their bones and their decaying. Thus, Allah says,\n\n\nأَءِذَا كُنَّا عِظَـٰمًا نَّخِرَةً\n\n\n(Even after we are bones Nakhirah) It has also been recited: (نَاخِرَةً) (Nakhirah) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah, all said, \"This means decayed.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"It is the bone when it has decayed and air enters into it.\" Concerning their saying,\n\n\nتِلْكَ إِذاً كَرَّةٌ خَـسِرَةٌ\n\n\n(It would in that case be a return with loss.) (79:12) Muhammad bin Ka`b said that the Quraysh said, \"If Allah brings us back to life after we die, then surely we will be losers.\" Allah then says,\n\n\nفَإِنَّمَا هِىَ زَجْرَةٌ وَحِدَةٌ - فَإِذَا هُم بِالسَّاهِرَةِ\n\n\n(But it will be only a single Zajrah. When behold, they are at As-Sahirah.) meaning, this is a matter that is from Allah that will not occur twice, nor will there be any opportunity to affirm it or verify it. The people will be standing and looking. This will be when Allah commands the angel Israfil to blow into the Sur, which will be the blowing of the resurrection. At that time the first people and the last people will all be standing before their Lord looking. This is as Allah says,\n\n\nيَوْمَ يَدْعُوكُمْ فَتَسْتَجِيبُونَ بِحَمْدِهِ وَتَظُنُّونَ إِن لَّبِثْتُمْ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً\n\n\n(On the Day when He will call you, and you will answer with His praise and obedience, and you will think that you have stayed but a little while!) (17:52) Allah has also said,\n\n\nوَمَآ أَمْرُنَآ إِلاَّ وَحِدَةٌ كَلَمْحٍ بِالْبَصَرِ\n\n\n(And our commandment is but one as the twinkling of an eye.) (54:50) Allah also says,\n\n\nوَمَآ أَمْرُ السَّاعَةِ إِلاَّ كَلَمْحِ الْبَصَرِ أَوْ هُوَ أَقْرَبُ\n\n\n(And the matter of the Hour is not but as a twinkling of the eye, or even nearer.) (16:77) Allah then says,\n\n\nفَإِذَا هُم بِالسَّاهِرَةِ\n\n\n(When behold, they are at As-Sahirah.) Ibn `Abbas said, \"As-Sahirah means the entire earth.\" Sa`id bin Jubayr, Qatadah and Abu Salih have all said this as well. `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Ad-Dahhak, and Ibn Zayd have all said, \"As-Sahirah means the face of the earth.\" Mujahid said, \"They will be at its (the earth's) lowest part, and they will be brought out to highest part.\" Then he said, \"As-Sahirah is a level place.\" Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said,\n\n\nفَإِذَا هُم بِالسَّاهِرَةِ\n\n\n(When behold, they are at As-Sahirah.) \"Allah says,\n\n\nيَوْمَ تُبَدَّلُ الاٌّرْضُ غَيْرَ الاٌّرْضِ وَالسَّمَـوَتُ وَبَرَزُواْ للَّهِ الْوَاحِدِ الْقَهَّارِ\n\n\n(On the Day when the earth will be changed to another earth and so will be the heavens, and they will appear before Allah, the One, the Irresistible.)

(54:46) Then Allah says,\nيَوْمَ يَتَذَكَّرُ الإِنسَـنُ مَا سَعَى\n(The Day when man shall remember what he strove for.) meaning, at that time the Son of Adam will reflect upon all of his deeds, both the good and the evil. This is as Allah says,\nيَوْمَئِذٍ يَتَذَكَّرُ الإِنسَـنُ وَأَنَّى لَهُ الذِّكْرَى\n(On the Day will man remember, but how will that remembrance avail him) (89:23) Then Allah says,\nوَبُرِّزَتِ الْجَحِيمُ لِمَن يَرَى\n(And Hell shall be made apparent for whoever sees.) meaning, it will become apparent for the onlookers, so the people will see it with their own eyes.\nفَأَمَّا مَن طَغَى\n(Then for him who transgressed) meaning, who rebels and behaves arrogantly.\nوَءاثَرَ الْحَيَوةَ الدُّنْيَا\n(And preferred the life of this world,) meaning, he gives it precedence over the matters of his religion and his Hereafter.\nفَإِنَّ الْجَحِيمَ هِىَ الْمَأْوَى\n(Verily his abode will be the Hell;) meaning, his final destination will be Hell, his food will be from the tree of Zaqqum, and his drink will be from Hamim.\nوَأَمَّا مَنْ خَافَ مَقَامَ رَبِّهِ وَنَهَى النَّفْسَ عَنِ الْهَوَى\n(But as for him who feared standing before his Lord and forbade himself from desire.) meaning, he fears the standing before Allah, he fears Allah's judgement of him, he prevents his soul from following its desires, and he compels it to obey its Master.\nفَإِنَّ الْجَنَّةَ هِىَ الْمَأْوَى\n(Verily Paradise will be his abode.) meaning, his final abode, his destination, and his place of return will be the spacious Paradise. Then Allah says,\nيَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ السَّاعَةِ أَيَّانَ مُرْسَـهَا - فِيمَ أَنتَ مِن ذِكْرَاهَا - إِلَى رَبِّكَ مُنتَهَـهَآ\n(They ask you about the Hour -- when will be its appointed time What do you have to mention of it. To your Lord it is limited.) meaning, its knowledge is not with you, nor with any creature. Rather the knowledge of it is with Allah. He is the One Who knows the exact time of its occurrence.\nثَقُلَتْ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ لاَ تَأْتِيكُمْ إِلاَّ بَغْتَةً يَسْـَلُونَكَ كَأَنَّكَ حَفِىٌّ عَنْهَا قُلْ إِنَّمَا عِلْمُهَا عِندَ اللَّهِ\n(Heavy is its burden through the heavens and the earth. It shall not come upon you except all of a sudden. They ask you as if you have a good knowledge of it. Say: \"The knowledge thereof is with Allah.\") (7:187) Allah says here,\nإِلَى رَبِّكَ مُنتَهَـهَآ\n(To your Lord it is limited.) Thus, when Jibril asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ about the time of the last Hour he said,\n«مَا الْمَسْؤُولُ عَنْهَا بِأَعْلَمَ مِنَ السَّائِل»\n(The one questioned about it knows no more than the questioner.) Allah said,\nإِنَّمَآ أَنتَ مُنذِرُ مَن يَخْشَـهَا\n(You are only a warner for those who fear it,) meaning, `I sent you to warn mankind and caution them to beware of the torment and punishment of Allah. So whoever fears Allah, fears standing before Him, and His threat, then he will follow you, and thus be successful and victorious. However, whoever denies you and opposes you, then he will only suffer loss and failure.' Allah then says,\nكَأَنَّهُمْ يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَهَا لَمْ يَلْبَثُواْ إِلاَّ عَشِيَّةً أَوْ ضُحَـهَا\n(The Day they see it (it will be) as if they had not tarried (in this world) except an (`Ashiyyah) afternoon or its (Duha) morning.) meaning, when they stand up from their graves to go to the place of Gathering, they will feel that the period of the worldy life was short, it will seem to them that it was only the afternoon of one day. Juwaybir reported from Ad-Dahhak from Ibn `Abbas:\nكَأَنَّهُمْ يَوْمَ يَرَوْنَهَا لَمْ يَلْبَثُواْ إِلاَّ عَشِيَّةً أَوْ ضُحَـهَا\n(The Day they see it (it will be) as if they had not tarried (in this world) except an (`Ashiyyah) afternoon or its (Duha) morning.) \"As for `Ashiyyah, it is the time between noon until the setting of the sun.\nأَوْ ضُحَـهَا\n(Or its (Duha) morning) what is between sunrise and midday (noon).\" Qatadah said, \"This refers to the time period of the worldly life in the eyes of the people when they see the Hereafter.\" This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat An-Nazi`at.
