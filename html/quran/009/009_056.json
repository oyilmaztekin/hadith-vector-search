    "text": "<h2>Exposing Hypocrites' Fright and Fear</h2><p>Allah describes to His Prophet the fright, fear, anxiety and nervousness of the hypocrites, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَحْلِفُونَ بِاللَّهِإِنَّهُمْ لَمِنكُمْ</div><p>(They swear by Allah that they are truly of you), swearing a sure oath, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا هُم مِّنكُمْ</div><p>(while they are not of you), in reality, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَـكِنَّهُمْ قَوْمٌ يَفْرَقُونَ</div><p>(but they are a people who are afraid), and this is what made them swear. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَوْ يَجِدُونَ مَلْجَئاً</div><p>(Should they find a refuge), such as a fort in which they hide and fortify themselves, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ مَغَـرَاتٍ</div><p>(or caves), in some mountains, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوْ مُدَّخَلاً</div><p>(or a place of concealment), a tunnel or a hole in the ground, according to the explanation given by Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Qatadah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّوَلَّوْاْ إِلَيْهِ وَهُمْ يَجْمَحُونَ</div><p>(they would turn straightway thereto with a swift rush) away from you because they associate with you unwillingly, not because they are fond of you. They prefer that they do not have to mix with you, but necessity has its rules! It is because of this that they feel grief, sadness and sorrow, seeing Islam and its people enjoying ever more might, triumph and glory. Therefore, whatever pleases Muslims brings them grief, and this is why they prefer to disassociate themselves from the believers. Hence Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَوْ يَجِدُونَ مَلْجَئاً أَوْ مَغَـرَاتٍ أَوْ مُدَّخَلاً لَّوَلَّوْاْ إِلَيْهِ وَهُمْ يَجْمَحُونَ </div><p>(Should they find a refuge, or caves, or a place of concealment, they would turn straightway thereto with a swift rush.) </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِنْهُمْ مَّن يَلْمِزُكَ فِي الصَّدَقَـتِ فَإِنْ أُعْطُواْ مِنْهَا رَضُواْ وَإِن لَّمْ يُعْطَوْاْ مِنهَا إِذَا هُمْ يَسْخَطُونَ </div>"
