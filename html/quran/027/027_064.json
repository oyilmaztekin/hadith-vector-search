Verily, He it is Who begins and repeats.)

Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, sends down water from the sky as a blessing, and causes it to penetrate the earth, and then come forth as springs. After that, by means of the water He brings forth all kinds of crops, fruits and flowers, in all their different forms and colors.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلُواْ وَارْعَوْا أَنْعَـمَكُمْ إِنَّ فِى ذلِكَ لأيَـتٍ لاٌّوْلِى النُّهَى </div><p>(Eat and pasture your cattle; verily, in this are signs for men of understanding) (20:54).

Surely, the disbelievers will not be successful.) (23:117)</p>"
