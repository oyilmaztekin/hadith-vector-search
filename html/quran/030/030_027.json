Ibn Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"This means it is easier for Him.\" Mujahid said: \"Repeating it is easier for Him than originating it, and originating it is easy for Him.\" This was also the view of `Ikrimah and others. Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Prophet said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«قَالَ اللهُ: كَذَّبَنِي ابْنُ آدَمَ وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ ذَلِكَ، وَشَتَمَنِي وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ ذَلِكَ، فَأَمَّا تَكْذِيبُهُ إِيَّايَ فَقَوْلُهُ: لَنْ يُعِيدَنِي كَمَا بَدَأَنِي وَلَيْسَ أَوَّلُ الْخَلْقِ بِأَهْوَنَ عَلَيَّ مِنْ إِعَادَتِهِ، وَأَمَّا شَتْمُهُ إِيَّايَ فَقَوْلُهُ: اتَّخَذَ اللهُ وَلَدًا، وَأَنَا الْأَحَدُ الصَّمَدُ الَّذِي لَمْ يَلِدْ وَلَمْ يُولَدْ وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ كُفُوًا أَحَد»</div><p>(Allah says; \"The son of Adam denied Me, and he had no right to do so. And he reviled Me, and he had no right to do so. As for his denying Me, it is his saying: `He will not remake me as He originated me' -- while originating the creation is not easier for Me than re-creating him. As for his reviling Me, it is his saying: `Allah has taken to Himself a son,' while I am the One, the Self-Sufficient Master; I beget not, nor was I begotten, and there is none comparable to Me.\") This was recorded only by Al-Bukhari.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَهُ الْمَثَلُ الأَعْلَى فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ</div><p>(His is the highest description in the heavens and in the earth. ) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported Ibn `Abbas said, \"This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَىْءٌ</div><p>(There is nothing like Him) (42:11).\" Qatadah said: \"His description is La ilaha illallah, and there is no Lord but He.\"</p>"
