This will be because of their sins, as Allah says of the past nations:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا ظَلَمْنَـهُمْ وَلَـكِن ظَلَمُواْ أَنفُسَهُمْ</div><p>(We wronged them not, but they wronged themselves.) 11:101</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَذَاقَتْ وَبَالَ أَمْرِهَا وَكَانَ عَـقِبَةُ أَمْرِهَا خُسْراً </div><p>(So it tasted the evil result of its affair (disbelief), and the consequence of its affair (disbelief) was loss.) 65:9</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَأِيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ عَتَتْ عَنْ أَمْرِ رَبِّهَا وَرُسُلِهِ</div><p>(And many a town (population) revolted against the command of its Lord and His Messengers;) 65:8 and many Ayat.</p>"
