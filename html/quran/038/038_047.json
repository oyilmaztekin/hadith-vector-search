Mujahid said, \"This means: We made them strive for the Hereafter, and there is nothing else for them besides that.\" As-Suddi also said, \"The remembrance of the Hereafter and striving for it.\" Malik bin Dinar said, \"Allah removed the love of this world from their hearts, and singled them out for land remembrance of the Hereafter.\" Qatadah said, \"They used to remind the people about the Abode of the Hereafter and to strive for it.\" </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّهُمْ عِندَنَا لَمِنَ الْمُصْطَفَيْنَ الاٌّخْيَارِ </div><p>(And they are with Us, verily, of the chosen and the best!) means, they are among those who have been elected and chosen, and they are the best and the chosen ones. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاذْكُرْ إِسْمَـعِيلَ وَالْيَسَعَ وَذَا الْكِفْلِ وَكُلٌّ مِّنَ الاٌّخْيَارِ </div><p>(And remember Isma`il, Al-Yasa`, and Dhul-Kifl, all are among the best.) We have already discussed their characteristics and stories in detail in Surat Al-Anbiya', may peace be upon them, and there is no need to repeat it here. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَـذَا ذِكْرُ</div><p>(This is a Reminder) means, a reminder to those who will be reminded. As-Suddi said, \"This means the Holy Qur'an.\" </p>"
