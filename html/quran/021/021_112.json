    "text": "<h2>The main Objective of Revelation is that Allah be worshipped</h2><p>Allah commands His Messenger to say to the idoators:</p><p>إِنَّمَآ يُوحَى إِلَىَّ أَنَّمَآ إِلَـهُكُمْ إِلَـهٌ وَحِدٌ فَهَلْ أَنتُمْ مُّسْلِمُونَ</p><p>(\"It is revealed to me that your God is only one God. Will you then be Muslims\") meaning, will you then follow that and submit to it</p><p>فَإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ</p><p>(But if they turn away) means, if they ignore that to which you call them.</p><p>فَقُلْ ءَاذَنتُكُمْ عَلَى سَوَآءٍ</p><p>(say: \"I give you a notice to be known to us all alike...\") meaning, `I declare that I am in a state of war with you as you are in a state of war with me. I have nothing to do with you just as you have nothing to do with me.' This is like the Ayah:</p><p>وَإِن كَذَّبُوكَ فَقُل لِّى عَمَلِى وَلَكُمْ عَمَلُكُمْ أَنتُمْ بَرِيئُونَ مِمَّآ أَعْمَلُ وَأَنَاْ بَرِىءٌ مِّمَّا تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(And if they belie you, say: \"For me are my deeds and for you are your deeds! You are innocent of what I do, and I am innocent of what you do!\") 10:41</p><p>وَإِمَّا تَخَافَنَّ مِن قَوْمٍ خِيَانَةً فَانبِذْ إِلَيْهِمْ عَلَى سَوَآءٍ</p><p>(If you fear treachery from any people, throw back (their covenant) to them (so as to be) on equal terms (that there will be no more covenant between you and them)) 8:58 which means: so that both you and they will know that the treaty is null and void. Similarly, Allah says here:</p><p>فَإِن تَوَلَّوْاْ فَقُلْ ءَاذَنتُكُمْ عَلَى سَوَآءٍ</p><p>(But if they turn away say: \"I give you a notice to be known to us all alike...\") meaning, `I have already informed you that I have nothing to do with you and you have nothing to do with me.'</p><h2>No one knows when the Hour will come</h2><p>وَإِنْ أَدْرِى أَقَرِيبٌ أَم بَعِيدٌ مَّا تُوعَدُونَ</p><p>(And I know not whether that which you are promised (i.e., the Day of Resurrection) is near or far.) meaning: `it will inevitably come to pass, but I have no knowledge of whether it is near or far.'</p><p>إِنَّهُ يَعْلَمُ الْجَهْرَ مِنَ الْقَوْلِ وَيَعْلَمُ مَا تَكْتُمُونَ</p><p>(Verily, He (Allah) knows that which is spoken aloud (openly) and He knows that which you conceal.) Allah knows the Unseen in its entirety; He knows what His creatures do openly and what they do secretly. He knows what is visible and what is concealed; He knows what is secret and hidden. He knows what His creatures do openly and in secret, and He will requite them for that, for both minor and major actions.</p><p>وَإِنْ أَدْرِى لَعَلَّهُ فِتْنَةٌ لَّكُمْ وَمَتَاعٌ إِلَى حِينٍ</p><p>(And I know not, perhaps it may be a trial for you, and an enjoyment for a while.) meaning, `I do not know, perhaps it is a trial for you, and an enjoyment for a while.' Ibn Jarir said: `perhaps that is being delayed for you as a test for you, and enjoyment for an allotted time.' This was narrated by `Awn from Ibn `Abbas. And Allah knows best.</p><p>قَالَ رَبِّ احْكُم بِالْحَقِّ</p><p>(He said: \"My Lord! Judge You in truth!) means, judge between us and our people who disbelieve in the truth. Qatadah said: \"The Prophets (peace be upon them) used to say:</p><p>رَبَّنَا افْتَحْ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَ قَوْمِنَا بِالْحَقِّ وَأَنتَ خَيْرُ الْفَـتِحِينَ</p><p>(\"Our Lord! Judge between us and our people in truth, for You are the Best of those who give judgment.\") 7:89, and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was commanded to say this too.\" It was reported from Malik from Zayd bin Aslam that when the Messenger of Allah ﷺ witnessed any fighting, he would say:</p><p>رَبِّ احْكُم بِالْحَقِّ</p><p>(\"My Lord! Judge You in truth!\")</p><p>وَرَبُّنَا الرَّحْمَـنُ الْمُسْتَعَانُ عَلَى مَا تَصِفُونَ</p><p>(Our Lord is the Most Gracious, Whose help is to be sought against that which you attribute!) means, `against the various lies and fabrications that you utter, some of which are worse than others; Allah is the One Whose Help we seek against that.' This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Anbiya'. To Allah be praise and blessings.</p>"
