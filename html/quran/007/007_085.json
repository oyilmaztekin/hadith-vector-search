    "text": "<h2>Story of Shu`ayb, upon him be Peace, and the Land of Madyan</h2><p>Muhammad bin Ishaq said, \"They (the people of Madyan) are the descendents of Madyan, son of Midyan, son of Ibrahim. Shu`ayb was the son of Mikil bin Yashjur. And in the Syrian language, his name was Yathrun (Jethro)\". I (Ibn Kathir) say, Madyan was the name of the tribe and also a city that is close to Ma`an on route to the Hijaz (from Ash-Sham). Allah said in another Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا وَرَدَ مَآءَ مَدْيَنَ وَجَدَ عَلَيْهِ أُمَّةً مِّنَ النَّاسِ يَسْقُونَ</div><p>(And when he arrived at the water (a well) of Madyan he found there a group of men watering (their flocks).) 28:23 They are also the people of Al-Aykah (the Woods), as we will mention later on, Allah willing, and our trust is in Him. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ يَاقَوْمِ اعْبُدُواْ اللَّهَ مَا لَكُمْ مِّنْ إِلَـهٍ غَيْرُهُ</div><p>(He said: \"O my people! Worship Allah! You have no other God but Him\") and this is the call of all Messengers, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَدْ جَآءَتْكُم بَيِّنَةٌ مِّن رَّبِّكُمْ</div><p>(\"Verily, a clear proof (sign) from your Lord has come unto you;\") meaning, `Allah has presented the proof and evidences of the truth of what I brought you.' He then advised them and commanded them to give full measure and full weight and not to wrong men in their dealings, meaning, to refrain from cheating people in buying and selling. They used to treacherously avoid giving full weight and measure. Allah said in other Ayat, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيْلٌ لِّلْمُطَفِّفِينَ </div><p>(Woe to Al-Mutaffifin (those who give less in measure and weight)...) 83:1 until He said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِرَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ</div><p>(before the Lord of all that exists) 83:6. These Ayat contain a stern warning and sure promise that we ask Allah to save us from. Shu`ayb was called `Speaker of the Prophets', because of his eloquent words and eloquent advice, and Allah stated that Shu`ayb said: </p>"
