    "text": "<h2>Lessons from the Destruction of Fir`awn, `Ad, Thamud, and the People of Nuh</h2><p>Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>وَفِى مُوسَى إِذْ أَرْسَلْنَـهُ إِلَى فِرْعَوْنَ بِسُلْطَـنٍ مُّبِينٍ</p><p>(And in Musa, when We sent him to Fir`awn with a manifest authority.) meaning, with clear proof and plain evidence,</p><p>فَتَوَلَّى بِرُكْنِهِ</p><p>(But he turned away along with his hosts,) meaning, in rebellion and arrogance, Fir`awn turned away from the plain truth that Musa was sent with,</p><p>ثَانِىَ عِطْفِهِ لِيُضِلَّ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ</p><p>(Bending his neck in pride, and leading (others) too (far) astray from the path of Allah.)(22:9 ), meaning turning away from truth in arrogance,</p><p>وَقَالَ سَـحِرٌ أَوْ مَجْنُونٌ</p><p>(and said: \"A sorcerer, or a madman.\") meaning Fir`awn said to Musa, \"With regards to the message that you brought me, you are either a magician or a madman.\" Allah the Exalted replied,</p><p>فَأَخَذْنَـهُ وَجُنُودَهُ فَنَبَذْنَـهُمْ</p><p>(So We took him and his armies, and dumped them), meaning `We threw them,'</p><p>فِى الْيَمِّ</p><p>(into the Yamm), into the sea,</p><p>وَهُوَ مُلِيمٌ</p><p>(for he was blameworthy.) meaning, Fir`awn was a denying sinner and a stubborn disbeliever worthy of blame. Allah the Exalted and Most Honored said,</p><p>وَفِى عَادٍ إِذْ أَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمُ الرِّيحَ الْعَقِيمَ</p><p>(And in `Ad when We sent against them the barren wind) that destroys everything and produces nothing. This was said by Ad-Dahhak, Qatadah and others. Allah's statement,</p><p>مَا تَذَرُ مِن شَىْءٍ أَتَتْ عَلَيْهِ</p><p>(It spared nothing that it reached,) meaning, everything that the wind could destroy,</p><p>إِلاَّ جَعَلَتْهُ كَالرَّمِيمِ</p><p>(but blew it into broken spreads of rotten ruins.) meaning, made it just like a rotten and destroyed. Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib and others commented on:</p><p>إِذْ أَرْسَلْنَا عَلَيْهِمُ الرِّيحَ الْعَقِيمَ</p><p>(when We sent against them the barren wind),\"Southerly winds.\" However, there is a Hadith in the Sahih from Shu`bah bin Al-Hakam, from Mujahid, from Ibn `Abbas, who said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«نُصِرْتُ بِالصَّبَا وَأُهْلِكَتْ عَادٌ بِالدَّبُور»</p><p>(I have been made victorious with the Saba (easterly wind), and the people of `Ad were destroyed with the Dabur (westerly wind).) Allah saying,</p><p>وَفِى ثَمُودَ إِذْ قِيلَ لَهُمْ تَمَتَّعُواْ حَتَّى حِينٍ</p><p>(And in Thamud, when they were told: \"Enjoy yourselves for a while!\") is just as He said in another Ayah,</p><p>وَأَمَّا ثَمُودُ فَهَدَيْنَـهُمْ فَاسْتَحَبُّواْ الْعَمَى عَلَى الْهُدَى فَأَخَذَتْهُمْ صَـعِقَةُ الْعَذَابِ الْهُونِ</p><p>(And as for Thamud, We guided them to the path of truth, but they preferred blindness to guidance; so the Sa`iqah of disgracing torment seized them.) (41:17) Allah said here,</p><p>وَفِى ثَمُودَ إِذْ قِيلَ لَهُمْ تَمَتَّعُواْ حَتَّى حِينٍ - فَعَتَوْاْ عَنْ أَمْرِ رَبِّهِمْ فَأَخَذَتْهُمُ الصَّاعِقَةُ وَهُمْ يَنظُرُونَ</p><p>(And in Thamud, when they were told: \"Enjoy yourselves for a while!\" But they insolently defied the command of their Lord, so the Sa`iqah overtook them while they were looking.) Thamud were given a respite for three days, during which they await the torment. In the early morning of the fourth day, the torment overtook them,</p><p>فَمَا اسْتَطَـعُواْ مِن قِيَامٍ</p><p>(Then they were unable to rise up,) they were unable to escape and run away from it,</p><p>وَمَا كَانُواْ مُنتَصِرِينَ</p><p>(nor could they help themselves.) nor could they save themselves from the torment that befell them. Allah the Exalted and Most Honored said,</p><p>وَقَوْمَ نُوحٍ مِّن قَبْلُ</p><p>((So were) the people of Nuh before them.) meaning, `We destroyed the people of Nuh before these people (Fir`awn, `Ad and Thamud).'</p><p>إِنَّهُمْ كَانُواْ قَوْماً فَـسِقِينَ</p><p>(Verily, they were a people who were revellious.) We mentioned these stories in details before in the Tafsir of several other Surahs.</p>"
