Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِيُوَفِّيَهُمْ أُجُورَهُمْ وَيَزِيدَهُم مِّن فَضْلِهِ</div><p>(That He may pay them their wages in full, and give them (even) more, out of His grace.) meaning, that He may give them a reward for what they have done, and multiply it by adding more, such as has never occurred to them.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ غَفُورٌ</div><p>(Verily, He is Oft-Forgiving,) means, He forgives their sins,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">شَكُورٍ</div><p>(Most Ready to appreciate.) means, He appreciates even a little of their good deeds.</p>"
