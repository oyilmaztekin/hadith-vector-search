Allah said in another Ayah,</p><p>وَمَا صَـحِبُكُمْ بِمَجْنُونٍ</p><p>(And (O people) your companion is not a madman.)81:22 Allah also said,</p><p>قُلْ إِنَّمَآ أَعِظُكُمْ بِوَحِدَةٍ أَن تَقُومُواْ لِلَّهِ مَثْنَى وَفُرَادَى ثُمَّ تَتَفَكَّرُواْ مَا بِصَـحِبِكُمْ مِّن جِنَّةٍ إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ نَذِيرٌ لَّكُمْ بَيْنَ يَدَىْ عَذَابٍ شَدِيدٍ</p><p>(Say: \"I exhort you to one (thing) only, that you stand up for Allah's sake in pairs and singly, and reflect, there is no madness in your companion. He is only a warner to you in face of a severe torment.\") 34:46 meaning, `I ask you to stand for Allah in sincerity without stubbornness or bias,'</p><p>مَثْنَى وَفُرَادَى</p><p>(in pairs and singly) 34:46 individuals and in groups,</p><p>ثُمَّ تَتَفَكَّرُواْ</p><p>(and reflect) 34:46, about this man who brought the Message from Allah, is he mad If you do this, it will become clear to you that he is the Messenger of Allah ﷺ in truth and justice. Qatadah bin Di'amah said, \"We were informed that the Prophet of Allah once was on (Mount) As-Safa and called the Quraysh, subtribe by subtribe, proclaiming,</p><p>«يَا بَنِي فُلَانٍ، يَا بَنِي فُلَانٍ فَحَذَّرَهُمْ بَأْسَ اللهِ وَوَقَائِعَ الله»</p><p>(O Children of so-and-so, O Children of so-and-so! He warned them against Allah's might and what He has done (such as revenge from His enemies).) Some of them commented, `This companion of yours (Prophet Muhammad) is mad; he kept shouting until the morning' Allah sent down this Ayah,</p><p>أَوَلَمْ يَتَفَكَّرُواْ مَا بِصَاحِبِهِم مِّن جِنَّةٍ إِنْ هُوَ إِلاَّ نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ</p><p>(Do they not reflect There is no madness in their companion. He is but a plain warner) 7:184.\"'</p>"
