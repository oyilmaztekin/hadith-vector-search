    "text": "<h2>People of the Scriptures try to extinguish the Light of Islam</h2><p>Allah says, the disbelieving idolators and People of the Scriptures want to,</p><p>أَن يُطْفِئُواْ نُورَ اللَّهِ</p><p>(extinguish the Light of Allah). They try through argument and lies to extinguish the guidance and religion of truth that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was sent with. Their example is the example of he who wants to extinguish the light of the sun or the moon by blowing at them! Indeed, such a person will never accomplish what he sought. Likewise, the light of what the Messenger was sent with will certainly shine and spread. Allah replied to the idolators' desire and hope,</p><p>وَيَأْبَى اللَّهُ إِلاَّ أَن يُتِمَّ نُورَهُ وَلَوْ كَرِهَ الْكَـفِرُونَ</p><p>(but Allah will not allow except that His Light should be perfected even though the disbelievers (Kafirun) hate (it)) 9:32. Linguistincally a Kafir is the person who covers something. For instance, night is called Kafiran covering because it covers things with darkness. The farmer is called Kafiran, because he covers seeds in the ground. Allah said in an Ayah,</p><p>أَعْجَبَ الْكُفَّارَ نَبَاتُهُ</p><p>(thereof the growth is pleasing to the Kuffar tillers)57:20.</p><h2>Islam is the Religion That will dominate over all Other Religions</h2><p>Allah said next,</p><p>هُوَ الَّذِي أَرْسَلَ رَسُولَهُ بِالْهُدَى وَدِينِ الْحَقِّ</p><p>(It is He Who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth.) `Guidance' refers to the true narrations, beneficial faith and true religion that the Messenger came with. `religion of truth' refers to the righteous, legal deeds that bring about benefit in this life and the Hereafter.</p><p>لِيُظْهِرَهُ عَلَى الدِّينِ كُلِّهِ</p><p>(to make it (Islam) superior over all religions) It is recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ زَوَى لِي الْأَرْضَ مَشَارِقَهَا وَمَغَارِبَهَا، وَسَيَبْلُغُ مُلْكُ أُمَّتِي مَا زُوِيَ لِييِمنْهَا»</p><p>(Allah made the eastern and western parts of the earth draw near for me to see, and the rule of my Ummah will extend as far as I saw.) Imam Ahmad recorded from Tamim Ad-Dari that he said, \"I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saying,</p><p>«لَيَبْلُغَنَّ هَذَا الْأَمْرُ مَا بَلَغَ اللَّيْلُ وَالنَّهَارُ، وَلَا يَتْرُكُ اللهُ بَيْتَ مَدَرٍ وَلَا وَبَرٍ إِلَّا أَدْخَلَهُ هَذَا الدِّينَ، يُعِزُّ عَزِيزًا وَيُذِلُّ ذَلِيلًا، عِزًّا يُعِزُّ اللهُ بِهِ الْإِسْلَامَ وَذُلًّا يُذِلُّ اللهُ بِهِ الْكُفْر»</p><p>(This matter (Islam) will keep spreading as far as the night and day reach, until Allah will not leave a house made of mud or hair, but will make this religion enter it, while bringing might to a mighty person (a Muslim) and humiliation to a disgraced person (who rejects Islam). Might with which Allah elevates Islam (and its people) and disgrace with which Allah humiliates disbelief (and its people).) Tamim Ad-Dari who was a Christian before Islam used to say, \"I have come to know the meaning of this Hadith in my own people. Those who became Muslims among them acquired goodness, honor and might. Disgrace, humiliation and Jizyah befell those who remained disbelievers.\"</p>"
