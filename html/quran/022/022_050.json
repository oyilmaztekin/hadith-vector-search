    "text": "<h2>The Recompense of the Righteous and the Unrighteous</h2><p>Allah said to His Prophet , when the disbelievers asked him to hasten on the punishment for them:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ يأَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنَّمَآ أَنَاْ لَكُمْ نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌ </div><p>(Say: \"O mankind! I am (sent) to you only as a plain warner.\") meaning, `Allah has sent me to you to warn you ahead of the terrible punishment, but I have nothing to do with your reckoning. Your case rests with Allah: if He wills, He will hasten on the punishment for you; and if He wills, He will delay it for you. If He wills he will accept the repentance of those who repent to Him; and if He wills, He will send astray those who are decreed to be doomed. He is the One Who does whatsoever He wills and wants and chooses.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ مُعَقِّبَ لِحُكْمِهِ وَهُوَ سَرِيعُ الْحِسَابِ</div><p>(There is none to put back His judgement and He is swift at reckoning.) 13:41</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّمَآ أَنَاْ لَكُمْ نَذِيرٌ مُّبِينٌفَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ</div><p>(I am (sent) to you only as a plain warner. So those who believe and do righteous good deeds,) means, whose hearts believe and whose actions confirm their faith.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّهُم مَّغْفِرَةٌ وَرِزْقٌ كَرِيمٌ</div><p>(for them is forgiveness and Rizq Karim. ) means, forgiveness for their previous bad deeds, and a great reward in return for a few good deeds. Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi said, \"When you hear Allah's saying:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَرِزْقٌ كَرِيمٌ</div><p>(Rizq Karim) this means Paradise.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ سَعَوْاْ فِى ءَايَـتِنَا مُعَـجِزِينَ</div><p>(But those who strive against Our Ayat to frustrate them,) Mujahid said, \"To discourage people from following the Prophet .\" This was also the view of `Abdullah bin Az-Zubayr, \"to discourage.\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"To frustrate them means to resist the believers stubbornly.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُوْلَـئِكَ أَصْحَـبُ الْجَحِيمِ</div><p>(they will be dwellers of the Hellfire.) This refers to the agonizingly hot Fire with its severe punish- ment, may Allah save us from it. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَصَدُّواْ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ زِدْنَـهُمْ عَذَابًا فَوْقَ الْعَذَابِ بِمَا كَانُواْ يُفْسِدُونَ </div><p>(Those who disbelieved and hinder (men) from the path of Allah, for them We will add torment to the torment because they used to spread corruption) 16:88</p>"
