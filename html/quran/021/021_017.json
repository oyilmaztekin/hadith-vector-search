    "text": "<h2>Creation was made with Justice and Wisdom</h2><p>Allah tells us that He created the heavens and the earth in truth, i.e. with justice.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لِيَجْزِىَ الَّذِينَ أَسَاءُواْ بِمَا عَمِلُواْ وَيِجْزِى الَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُواْ بِالْحُسْنَى</div><p>(that He may requite those who do evil with that which they have done, and reward those who do good, with what is best.) 53:31. He did not create all that in vain or for (mere) play:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا خَلَقْنَا السَّمَآءَ وَالاٌّرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا بَـطِلاً ذَلِكَ ظَنُّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فَوَيْلٌ لِّلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنَ النَّارِ </div><p>(And We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them without purpose! That is the consideration of those who disbelieve! Then woe to those who disbelieve from the Fire!) 38:27</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَوْ أَرَدْنَآ أَن نَّتَّخِذَ لَهْواً لاَّتَّخَذْنَـهُ مِن لَّدُنَّآ إِن كُنَّا فَـعِلِينَ </div><p>(Had We intended to take a pastime, We could surely have taken it from Us, if We were going to do (that).) Ibn Abi Najih said, narrating from Mujahid:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَوْ أَرَدْنَآ أَن نَّتَّخِذَ لَهْواً لاَّتَّخَذْنَـهُ مِن لَّدُنَّآ</div><p>(Had We intended to take a pastime, We could surely have taken it from Us,) \"Meaning, `From Ourself,' He is saying, `We would not have created Paradise or Hell or death or the resurrection or the Reckoning.\"'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِن كُنَّا فَـعِلِينَ</div><p>(if We were going to do (that). ) Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i and Mughirah bin Miqsam said: \"This means, `We will not do that.\"' Mujahid said, every time the word</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَنْ</div><p>(if) is used in the Qur'an, it is a negation.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بَلْ نَقْذِفُ بِالْحَقِّ عَلَى الْبَـطِلِ</div><p>(Nay, We fling the truth against the falsehood,) means, `We explain the truth and thus defeat falsehood.' Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَيَدْمَغُهُ فَإِذَا هُوَ زَاهِقٌ</div><p>(so it destroys it, and behold, it disappears.) it is fading and vanishing.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَكُمُ الْوَيْلُ</div><p>(And woe to you) O you who say that Allah has offspring.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مِمَّا تَصِفُونَ</div><p>(for that which you ascribe.) that which you say and fabricate. Then Allah informs of the servitude of the angels, and how they persevere in worship night and day:</p><h2>Everything belongs to Allah and serves Him</h2><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَهُ مَن فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَمَنْ عِنْدَهُ</div><p>(To Him belongs whosoever is in the heavens and on earth. And those who are near Him) i.e., the angels,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ يَسْتَكْبِرُونَ عَنْ عِبَادَتِهِ</div><p>(are not too proud to worship Him,) they do not feel proud and do not refuse to worship Him. This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّن يَسْتَنكِفَ الْمَسِيحُ أَن يَكُونَ عَبْداً للَّهِ وَلاَ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ الْمُقَرَّبُونَ وَمَن يَسْتَنْكِفْ عَنْ عِبَادَتِهِ وَيَسْتَكْبِرْ فَسَيَحْشُرُهُمْ إِلَيهِ جَمِيعاً </div><p>(Al-Masih will never be proud to reject being a servant of Allah, nor the angels who are the near. And whosoever rejects His worship and is proud, then He will gather them all together unto Himself.) 4:172</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَسْتَحْسِرُونَ</div><p>(nor are they weary.) means, they do not get tired or feel bored.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يُسَبِّحُونَ الْلَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَارَ لاَ يَفْتُرُونَ </div><p>(They glorify His praises night and day, they never slacken.) They persist in their worship night and day, obeying Allah to the utmost, and they are able to do this, as Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَّ يَعْصُونَ اللَّهَ مَآ أَمَرَهُمْ وَيَفْعَلُونَ مَا يُؤْمَرُونَ</div><p>(who do not disobey Allah in what He commands them, but do what they are commanded) 66:6</p>"
