What has been revealed to you from your Lord is the Truth, no doubt, and there is no deity worthy of worship except Him, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَعْرِضْ عَنِ الْمُشْرِكِينَ</div><p>(and turn aside from the idolators) meaning, forgive them, be forbearing and endure their harm until Allah brings relief to you, supports you and makes you triumphant over them. Know -- O Muhammad -- that there is a wisdom behind misleading the idolators, and that had Allah willed, He would have directed all people to guidance, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ شَآءَ اللَّهُ مَآ أَشْرَكُواْ</div><p>(Had Allah willed, they would not have taken others besides Him in worship.) Allah's is the perfect will and wisdom in all decrees and decisions, and He is never questioned about what He does, while they all will be questioned. Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا جَعَلْنَـكَ عَلَيْهِمْ حَفِيظاً</div><p>(And We have not made you Hafiz over them.) means, a watcher who observes their statements and deeds, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَآ أَنتَ عَلَيْهِم بِوَكِيلٍ</div><p>(Nor are you set over them to dispose of their affairs. ) or to control their provision. Rather, your only job is to convey, just as Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَذَكِّرْ إِنَّمَآ أَنتَ مُذَكِّرٌ - لَّسْتَ عَلَيْهِم بِمُسَيْطِرٍ </div><p>(So remind them, you are only one who reminds. You are not a dictator over them.) 88:21-22 and, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِنَّمَا عَلَيْكَ الْبَلَـغُ وَعَلَيْنَا الْحِسَابُ</div><p>(Your duty is only to convey and on Us is the reckoning.) 13:40 </p>"
