Have Taqwa of your Lord.) Until His saying,\nوَلَـكِنَّ عَذَابَ اللَّهِ شَدِيدٌ\n(but Allah's torment is severe.) were revealed, the Prophet was on a journey, and he said:\n«أَتَدْرُونَ أَيُّ يَوْمٍ ذَلِكَ؟ قَالُوا: اللهُ وَرَسُولُهُ أَعْلَمُ. قَالَ: ذَلِكَ يَوْمٌ يَقُولُ اللهُ لِآدَمَ: ابْعَثْ بَعْثَ النَّارِ، قَالَ: يَا رَبِّ وَمَا بَعْثُ النَّارِ؟ قالَ: تِسْعُمِائَةٍ وَتِسْعَةٌ وَتِسْعُونَ إِلَى النَّارِ وَوَاحِدٌ إِلَى الْجَنَّة»\n(Do you know what Day that is) They said, \"Allah and His Messenger know best.\" (He said: That is the Day on which Allah will say to Adam, \"Send forth (those of your progeny) who are to be sent to the Fire.\" He will say, \"O Lord, how many are to be sent to the Fire\" He will say, \"From every thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine will be in the Fire and one will be in Paradise.\") The Muslims started to weep, then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«قَارِبُوا وَسَدِّدُوا، فَإِنَّهَا لَمْ تَكُنْ نُبُوَّةٌ قَطُّ إِلَّا كَانَ بَيْنَ يَدَيْهَا جَاهِلِيَّةٌ، قَالَ: فَيُؤْخَذُ الْعَدَدُ مِنَ الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ، فَإِنْ تَمَّتْ، وَإِلَّا كُمِّلَتْ مِنَ الْمُنَافِقِينَ، وَمَا مَثَلُكُمْ وَمَثَلُ الْأُمَمِ إِلَّا كَمَثَلِ الرَّقْمَةِ فِي ذِرَاعِ الدَّابَّةِ، أَوْ كَالشَّامَةِ فِي جَنْبِ الْبَعِير»\n(Be close in your rank and be straight forward, for there was never any Prophet but there was a time of ignorance just before his advent, so the number will be taken from that time of ignorance, and if that is not enough, it will be made up from the hypocrites. A parable of yours in comparison to the other nations is that, you are like a mark on the foreleg of an animal, or a mole on the flank of a camel.) Then he said,\n«إِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»\n(I hope that you will be a quarter of the people of Paradise.) They said, \"Allahu Akbar!\" Then he said,\n«إِنِّييَلَأرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا ثُلُثَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»\n(I hope that you will be a third of the people of Paradise.) They said, \"Allahu Akbar!\" Then he said,\n«إِنِّييَلَأرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا نِصْفَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّة»\n(I hope that you will be half of the people of Paradise.) They said, \"Allahu Akbar!\" Then he the narrator said, \"I do not know if he said two-thirds or not.\" This was also recorded by Imam Ahmad. Then At-Tirmidhi also said, \"This is a Hasan Sahih Hadith.\" In his Tafsir, under this Ayah, Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Sa`id said, \"The Prophet said:\n«يَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالَى يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ: يَا آدَمُ، فَيَقُولُ: لَبَّيْكَ رَبَّنَا وَسَعْدَيْكَ، فَيُنَادَى بِصَوْتٍ: إِنَّ اللهَ يَأْمُرُكَ أَنْ تُخْرِجَ مِنْ ذُرِّيَّتِكَ بَعْثًا إِلَى النَّارِ، قَالَ: يَا رَبِّ وَمَا بَعْثُ النَّارِ؟ قَالَ: مِنْ كُلِّ أَلْفٍ أُرَاهُ قَالَ تِسْعُمِائَةٍ وَتِسْعَةٌ وَتِسْعُونَ، فَحِينَئِذٍ تَضَعُ الْحَامِلُ حَمْلَهَا وَيَشِيبُ الْوَلِيدُ\nوَتَرَى النَّاسَ سُكَـرَى وَمَا هُم بِسُكَـرَى وَلَـكِنَّ عَذَابَ اللَّهِ شَدِيدٌ\n(On the Day of Resurrection, Allah will say: \"O Adam.\" He will say, \"At Your service, O Lord.\" Then a voice will call out: \"Allah commands you to send forth from your progeny those who are destined for the Fire.\" He will say, \"O Lord, who is destined for the Fire\" He will say, \"From every thousand\" -- I think he said -- \"nine hundred and ninety-nine.\" At that time every pregnant female will drop her load and children will turn grey. (and you shall see mankind as in a drunken state, yet they will not be drunken, but Allah's torment is severe.)) That will be so difficult for mankind to bear that their faces will change. The Prophet said:\n«مِنْ يَأْجُوجَ وَمَأْجُوجَ تِسْعُمِائَةٍ وَتِسْعَةٌ وَتِسْعُونَ، وَمِنْكُمْ وَاحِدٌ، أَنْتُمْ فِي النَّاسِ كَالشَّعْرَةِ السَّوْدَاءِ فِي جَنْبِ الثَّوْرِ الْأَبْيَضِ، أَوْ كَالشَّعْرَةِ الْبَيْضَاءِ فِي جَنْبِ الثَّوْرِ الْأَسْوَدِ، وَإِنِّي لَأَرْجُو أَنْ تَكُونُوا رُبُعَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ ، فَكَبَّرْنَا. ثُمَّ قَالَ: ثُلُثَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ ، فَكَبَّرْنَا. ثُمَّ قَالَ: شَطْرَ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، فَكَبَّرْنا»\n(Nine hundred and ninety-nine from Ya'juj and Ma'juj, and one from you. Among mankind you are like a black hair on the side of a white bull, or a white hair on the side of a black bull. I hope that you will be one quarter of the people of Paradise.) We said \"Allahu Akbar!\" Then he said, (A third of the people of Paradise.) We said, \"Allahu Akbar!\" Then he said, (One half of the people of Paradise.) We said: `Allahu Akbar!\" Al-Bukhari also recorded this elsewhere. It was also recorded by Muslim, and An-Nasa'i in his Tafsir. The Hadiths and reports about the terrors of the Day of Resurrection are very many, and this is not the place to quote them all.\nإِنَّ زَلْزَلَةَ السَّاعَةِ شَىْءٌ عَظِيمٌ\n(Verily, the earthquake of the Hour is a terrible thing.) means, a serious matter, a terrifying crisis, a horrendous event.

Then it changes and becomes a lump of flesh, like a piece of meat with no form or shape. Then it starts to take on a form and shape, developing a head, arms, chest, stomach, thighs, legs, feet and all its members. Sometimes a woman miscarries before the fetus is formed and sometimes she miscarries after it has formed.

Then he blows the soul into him.)\"</p><h2>Man's Development from Infancy to Old Age His saying;</h2><p>ثُمَّ نُخْرِجُكُمْ طِفْلاً</p><p>(then We bring you out as infants,) means, weak in his body, hearing, sight, senses, stamina and mind. Then Allah gives him strength, gradually and causes his parents to treat him with tender kindness night and day. Allah says:</p><p>ثُمَّ لِتَـبْلُغُواْ أَشُدَّكُـمْ</p><p>(then (give you growth) that you may reach your age of full strength.) meaning, his strength increases until he reaches the vitality and handsomeness of youth.</p><p>وَمِنكُمْ مَّن يُتَوَفَّى</p><p>(And among you there is he who dies,) means, when he is young and strong.</p><p>وَمِنكُم مَّن يُرَدُّ إِلَى أَرْذَلِ الْعُمُرِ</p><p>(and among you there is he who is brought back to the miserable old age,) meaning advanced old age with its weakness in mind and body, in steady decline in comprehension, and disability to grasp. As Allah says:</p><p>لِكَيْلاَ يَعْلَمَ مِن بَعْدِ عِلْمٍ شَيْئاً</p><p>(so that he knows nothing after having known.)</p><p>اللَّهُ الَّذِى خَلَقَكُمْ مِّن ضَعْفٍ ثُمَّ جَعَلَ مِن بَعْدِ ضَعْفٍ قُوَّةٍ ثُمَّ جَعَلَ مِن بَعْدِ قُوَّةٍ ضَعْفاً وَشَيْبَةً يَخْلُقُ مَا يَشَآءُ وَهُوَ الْعَلِيمُ الْقَدِيرُ</p><p>(Allah is He Who created you in (a state of) weakness, then gave you strength after weakness, then after strength gave (you) weakness and grey hair.

Allah says:\nوَأَنبَتَتْ مِن كُلِّ زَوْجٍ بَهِيجٍ\n(and puts forth every lovely kind (of growth).) meaning, beautiful in appearance and with delightful fragrances.\nذلِكَ بِأَنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْحَقُّ\n(That is because Allah: He is the Truth,) means, the Creator, the Controller, the One Who does as He wills.\nوَأَنَّهُ يُحْىِ الْمَوْتَى\n(and it is He Who gives life to the dead,) means, just as He gives life to the dead earth and brings forth from it all these kinds of vegetation.\nإِنَّ الَّذِى أَحْيَـهَا لَمُحْىِ الْمَوْتَى إِنَّهُ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ\n(Verily, He Who gives it life, surely is able to give life to the dead. Indeed He is able to do all things.) 41:39\nإِنَّمَآ أَمْرُهُ إِذَآ أَرَادَ شَيْئاً أَن يَقُولَ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ\n(Verily, His command, when He intends a thing, is only that He says to it, \"Be!\" -- and it is!) 36:82.\nوَأَنَّ السَّاعَةَ ءَاتِيَةٌ لاَّ رَيْبَ فِيهَا\n(And surely, the Hour is coming, there is no doubt about it;) meaning, it will inevitably come to pass.\nوَأَنَّ اللَّهَ يَبْعَثُ مَن فِى الْقُبُورِ\n(and certainly, Allah will resurrect those who are in the graves.) means, He will bring them back to life after they have become dust; He will create them anew after they have become nothing.\nوَضَرَبَ لَنَا مَثَلاً وَنَسِىَ خَلْقَهُ قَالَ مَن يُحىِ الْعِظَـمَ وَهِىَ رَمِيمٌ\nقُلْ يُحْيِيهَا الَّذِى أَنشَأَهَآ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ وَهُوَ بِكُلِّ خَلْقٍ عَلِيمٌ - الَّذِى جَعَلَ لَكُم مِّنَ الشَّجَرِ الاٌّخْضَرِ نَاراً فَإِذَآ أَنتُم مِّنْه تُوقِدُونَ\n(And he puts forth for Us a parable, and forgets his own creation. He says: \"Who will give life to these bones after they are rotten and have become dust\" Say: \"He will give life to them Who created them for the first time! And He is the All-Knower of every creation!\" He Who produces for you fire out of the green tree, when behold you kindle there- with.) 36:78-80.

They prevent the believers who want to go there from reaching it, although the believers have more right than anyone else to go there. The structure of this phrase is like that to be found in the Ayah:</p><p>الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَتَطْمَئِنُّ قُلُوبُهُمْ بِذِكْرِ اللَّهِ أَلاَ بِذِكْرِ اللَّهِ تَطْمَئِنُّ الْقُلُوبُ</p><p>(Those who believed, and whose hearts find rest in the remembrance of Allah, verily, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest.) 13:28 Not only are they believers, but their hearts also find rest in the remembrance of Allah.</p><h2>The Issue of renting Houses in Makkah</h2><p>الَّذِى جَعَلْنَـهُ لِلنَّاسِ سَوَآءً الْعَـكِفُ فِيهِ وَالْبَادِ</p><p>(which We have made (open) to (all) men, the dweller in it and the visitor from the country are equal there) meaning that they prevent people from reaching Al-Masjid Al-Haram, which Allah has made equally accessible to all in Shari`ah, with no differentiation between those who live there and those who live far away from it.</p><p>سَوَآءً الْعَـكِفُ فِيهِ وَالْبَادِ</p><p>(the dweller in it and the visitor from the country are equal there,) Part of this equality is that everyone has equal access to all parts of the city and can live there, as `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas concerning the Ayah:</p><p>سَوَآءً الْعَـكِفُ فِيهِ وَالْبَادِ</p><p>(the dweller in it and the visitor from the country are equal there,) He Ibn `Abbas said: \"Both the people of Makkah and others can stay in Al-Masjid Al-Haram.\"</p><p>سَوَآءً الْعَـكِفُ فِيهِ وَالْبَادِ</p><p>(the dweller in it and the visitor from the country are equal there,) Mujahid said, \"The people of Makkah and others are equally allowed to stay there.\" This was also the view of Abu Salih, `Abdur-Rahman bin Sabit and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam. `Abdur-Razzaq narrated from Ma`mar, from Qatadah who said: \"Its own people and others are equal therein.\" This is the issue about which Ash-Shafi`i and Ishaq bin Rahwayh differed in the Masjid of Al-Khayf, when Ahmad bin Hanbal was also present. Ash-Shafi`i was of the opinion that the various parts of Makkah can be owned, inherited and rented, and he used as evidence the Hadith of Usamah bin Zayd who said, \"I said, O Messenger of Allah, will you go and stay tomorrow in your house in Makkah\" He said,</p><p>«وَهَلْ تَرَكَ لَنَا عَقِيلٌ مِنْ رِبَاعٍ؟»</p><p>(Has `Aqil left us any property) Then he said,</p><p>«لَا يَرِثُ الْكَافِرُ الْمُسْلِمَ وَلَا الْمُسْلِمُ الْكَافِر»</p><p>(A disbeliever does not inherit from a Muslim and a Muslim does not inherit from a disbeliever.) This Hadith was recorded in the Two Sahihs. He also used as evidence the report that `Umar bin Al-Khattab bought a house in Makkah from Safwan bin Umayyah for four thousand Dinars, and made it into a prison. This was also the view of Tawus and `Amr bin Dinar. Ishaq bin Rahwayh was of the opinion that they (houses in Makkah) could not be inherited or rented. This was the view of a number of the Salaf, and Mujahid and `Ata' said likewise. Ishaq bin Rahwayh used as evidence the report recorded by Ibn Majah from `Alqamah bin Nadlah who said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ, Abu Bakr and `Umar died, and nobody claimed any property in Makkah except the grazing animals. Whoever needed to live there would take up residence there, and whoever did not need to live there would let others take up residence there.\" `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said, \"It is not allowed to sell or rent the houses of Makkah.\" He also said, narrating from Ibn Jurayj: \"`Ata' would not allow people to charge rent in the Haram, and he told me that `Umar bin Al-Khattab did not allow people to put gates on the houses of Makkah because the pilgrims used to stay in their courtyards. The first person to put a gate on his house was Suhayl bin `Amr. `Umar bin Al-Khattab sent for him about that and he said, `Listen to me, O Commander of the faithful, I am a man who engages in trade and I want to protect my back.' He said, `Then you may do that.\"' `Abdur-Razzaq recorded from Mujahid that `Umar bin Al-Khattab said, \"O people of Makkah, do not put gates on your houses, and let the bedouins stay wherever they want.\" He said: Ma`mar told us, narrating from someone who heard `Ata' say about the Ayah, x</p><p>سَوَآءً الْعَـكِفُ فِيهِ وَالْبَادِ</p><p>(the dweller in it and the visitor from the country are equal there, ) \"They may stay wherever they want.\" Ad-Daraqutni recorded a saying reported from `Abdullah bin `Amr: \"Whoever charges rent for the houses of Makkah, consumes fire.\" Imam Ahmad took a middle path, according to what his son Salih narrated from him, and he said, \"They may be owned and inherited, but they should not be rented, so as to reconcile between all the proofs.\" And Allah knows best.</p><h2>A Warning to Those Who want to commit Evil Actions in the Haram</h2><p>وَمَن يُرِدْ فِيهِ بِإِلْحَادٍ بِظُلْمٍ نُّذِقْهُ مِنْ عَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ</p><p>(and whoever inclines to evil actions therein or to do wrong, him We shall cause to taste from a painful torment.)</p><p>بِظُلْمٍ</p><p>(or to do wrong,) means, he aims deliberately to do wrong, and it is not the matter of misunderstanding. As Ibn Jurayj said narrating from Ibn `Abbas, \"This means someone whose actions are intentional.\" `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The evil action of Shirk.\" Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said: \"The evil action is allowing in the Haram what Allah has forbidden, such as mistreating and killing, whereby you do wrong to those who have done you no wrong and you kill those who have not fought you.

Sa`id bin Jubayr said, \"Insulting a servant and anything more than that is (counted as) wrongdoing.\" Habib bin Abi Thabit said:</p><p>وَمَن يُرِدْ فِيهِ بِإِلْحَادٍ بِظُلْمٍ</p><p>(and whoever inclines to evil actions therein or to do wrong,) \"Hoarding (goods) in Makkah.\" This was also the view of others.</p><p>وَمَن يُرِدْ فِيهِ بِإِلْحَادٍ بِظُلْمٍ</p><p>(and whoever inclines to evil actions therein or to do wrong,) Ibn `Abbas said, \"This was revealed about `Abdullah bin Unays.

Hence when the owners of the Elephant planned to destroy the House (the Ka`bah), Allah sent against them birds in flocks,</p><p>تَرْمِيهِم بِحِجَارَةٍ مِّن سِجِّيلٍ - فَجَعَلَهُمْ كَعَصْفٍ مَّأْكُولِ</p><p>(Striking them with stones of Sijjil. And He made them like (an empty field of) stalks (of which the corn has been eaten up by cattle).) 105:4-5. means He destroyed them and made them a lesson and a warning for everyone who intends to commit evil actions there. Hence it was reported in a Hadith that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«يَغْزُو هَذَا الْبَيْتَ جَيْشٌ حَتَّى إِذَا كَانُوا بِبَيْدَاءَ مِنَ الْأَرْضِ خُسِفَ بِأَوَّلِهِمْ وَآخِرِهِم»</p><p>(This House will be attacked by an army, then when they are in a wide open space, the first of them and the last of them will be swallowed up by the earth.)</p>", "text_plain": "A Warning to Those Who hinder Others from the Path of Allah and from Al-Masj id Al-Haram and Who seek to do Evil Actions therein\nAllah rebukes the disbelievers for preventing the believers from coming to Al-Masjid Al-Haram and performing their rites and rituals there, claiming that they were its guardians,\nوَمَا كَانُواْ أَوْلِيَآءَهُ إِنْ أَوْلِيَآؤُهُ إِلاَّ الْمُتَّقُونَ\n(and they are not its guardians. None can be its guardians except those who have Taqwa) 8:34. In this Ayah there is proof that it was revealed in Al-Madinah, as Allah says in Surat Al-Baqarah:\nيَسْـَلُونَكَ عَنِ الشَّهْرِ الْحَرَامِ قِتَالٍ فِيهِ قُلْ قِتَالٌ فِيهِ كَبِيرٌ وَصَدٌّ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَكُفْرٌ بِهِ وَالْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ وَإِخْرَاجُ أَهْلِهِ مِنْهُ أَكْبَرُ عِندَ اللَّهِ\n(They ask you concerning fighting in the Sacred Months. Say, \"Fighting therein is a great (transgression) but a greater (transgression) with Allah is to prevent mankind from following the way of Allah, to disbelieve in Him, to prevent access to Al-Masjid Al-Haram, and to drive out its inhabitants) 2:217 And Allah says here:\nإِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَيَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ وَالْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ\n(Verily, those who disbelieved and hinder (men) from the path of Allah, and from Al-Masjid Al-Haram) meaning, not only are they disbelievers, but they also hinder people from the path of Allah and from Al-Masjid Al-Haram. They prevent the believers who want to go there from reaching it, although the believers have more right than anyone else to go there. The structure of this phrase is like that to be found in the Ayah:\nالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَتَطْمَئِنُّ قُلُوبُهُمْ بِذِكْرِ اللَّهِ أَلاَ بِذِكْرِ اللَّهِ تَطْمَئِنُّ الْقُلُوبُ\n(Those who believed, and whose hearts find rest in the remembrance of Allah, verily, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest.) 13:28 Not only are they believers, but their hearts also find rest in the remembrance of Allah.\nThe Issue of renting Houses in Makkah\nالَّذِى جَعَلْنَـهُ لِلنَّاسِ سَوَآءً الْعَـكِفُ فِيهِ وَالْبَادِ\n(which We have made (open) to (all) men, the dweller in it and the visitor from the country are equal there) meaning that they prevent people from reaching Al-Masjid Al-Haram, which Allah has made equally accessible to all in Shari`ah, with no differentiation between those who live there and those who live far away from it.\nسَوَآءً الْعَـكِفُ فِيهِ وَالْبَادِ\n(the dweller in it and the visitor from the country are equal there,) Part of this equality is that everyone has equal access to all parts of the city and can live there, as `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas concerning the Ayah:\nسَوَآءً الْعَـكِفُ فِيهِ وَالْبَادِ\n(the dweller in it and the visitor from the country are equal there,) He Ibn `Abbas said: \"Both the people of Makkah and others can stay in Al-Masjid Al-Haram.\"\nسَوَآءً الْعَـكِفُ فِيهِ وَالْبَادِ\n(the dweller in it and the visitor from the country are equal there,) Mujahid said, \"The people of Makkah and others are equally allowed to stay there.\" This was also the view of Abu Salih, `Abdur-Rahman bin Sabit and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam. `Abdur-Razzaq narrated from Ma`mar, from Qatadah who said: \"Its own people and others are equal therein.\" This is the issue about which Ash-Shafi`i and Ishaq bin Rahwayh differed in the Masjid of Al-Khayf, when Ahmad bin Hanbal was also present. Ash-Shafi`i was of the opinion that the various parts of Makkah can be owned, inherited and rented, and he used as evidence the Hadith of Usamah bin Zayd who said, \"I said, O Messenger of Allah, will you go and stay tomorrow in your house in Makkah\" He said,\n«وَهَلْ تَرَكَ لَنَا عَقِيلٌ مِنْ رِبَاعٍ؟»\n(Has `Aqil left us any property) Then he said,\n«لَا يَرِثُ الْكَافِرُ الْمُسْلِمَ وَلَا الْمُسْلِمُ الْكَافِر»\n(A disbeliever does not inherit from a Muslim and a Muslim does not inherit from a disbeliever.) This Hadith was recorded in the Two Sahihs. He also used as evidence the report that `Umar bin Al-Khattab bought a house in Makkah from Safwan bin Umayyah for four thousand Dinars, and made it into a prison. This was also the view of Tawus and `Amr bin Dinar. Ishaq bin Rahwayh was of the opinion that they (houses in Makkah) could not be inherited or rented. This was the view of a number of the Salaf, and Mujahid and `Ata' said likewise. Ishaq bin Rahwayh used as evidence the report recorded by Ibn Majah from `Alqamah bin Nadlah who said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ, Abu Bakr and `Umar died, and nobody claimed any property in Makkah except the grazing animals. Whoever needed to live there would take up residence there, and whoever did not need to live there would let others take up residence there.\" `Abdur-Razzaq recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said, \"It is not allowed to sell or rent the houses of Makkah.\" He also said, narrating from Ibn Jurayj: \"`Ata' would not allow people to charge rent in the Haram, and he told me that `Umar bin Al-Khattab did not allow people to put gates on the houses of Makkah because the pilgrims used to stay in their courtyards. The first person to put a gate on his house was Suhayl bin `Amr. `Umar bin Al-Khattab sent for him about that and he said, `Listen to me, O Commander of the faithful, I am a man who engages in trade and I want to protect my back.' He said, `Then you may do that.\"' `Abdur-Razzaq recorded from Mujahid that `Umar bin Al-Khattab said, \"O people of Makkah, do not put gates on your houses, and let the bedouins stay wherever they want.\" He said: Ma`mar told us, narrating from someone who heard `Ata' say about the Ayah, x\nسَوَآءً الْعَـكِفُ فِيهِ وَالْبَادِ\n(the dweller in it and the visitor from the country are equal there, ) \"They may stay wherever they want.\" Ad-Daraqutni recorded a saying reported from `Abdullah bin `Amr: \"Whoever charges rent for the houses of Makkah, consumes fire.\" Imam Ahmad took a middle path, according to what his son Salih narrated from him, and he said, \"They may be owned and inherited, but they should not be rented, so as to reconcile between all the proofs.\" And Allah knows best.\nA Warning to Those Who want to commit Evil Actions in the Haram\nوَمَن يُرِدْ فِيهِ بِإِلْحَادٍ بِظُلْمٍ نُّذِقْهُ مِنْ عَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ\n(and whoever inclines to evil actions therein or to do wrong, him We shall cause to taste from a painful torment.)\nبِظُلْمٍ\n(or to do wrong,) means, he aims deliberately to do wrong, and it is not the matter of misunderstanding. As Ibn Jurayj said narrating from Ibn `Abbas, \"This means someone whose actions are intentional.\" `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"The evil action of Shirk.\" Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said: \"The evil action is allowing in the Haram what Allah has forbidden, such as mistreating and killing, whereby you do wrong to those who have done you no wrong and you kill those who have not fought you. If a person does this, then he deserves to suffer a painful torment.\"\nبِظُلْمٍ\n(or to do wrong,) Mujahid said, \"To do some bad action therein. This is one of the unique features of Al-Haram, that the person who is about to do some evil action should be punished if this is his intention, even if he has not yet commenced the action.\" Ibn Abi Hatim recorded in his Tafsir that `Abdullah (i.e., Ibn Mas`ud) commented about the Ayah,\nوَمَن يُرِدْ فِيهِ بِإِلْحَادٍ بِظُلْمٍ\n(and whoever inclines to evil actions therein or to do wrong,) \"If a man intends to do some evil action therein, Allah will make him taste a painful torment.\" This was also recorded by Ahmad. I say, its chain is Sahih according to the conditions of Al-Bukhari, and it is more likely Mawquf than Marfu`. And Allah knows best. Sa`id bin Jubayr said, \"Insulting a servant and anything more than that is (counted as) wrongdoing.\" Habib bin Abi Thabit said:\nوَمَن يُرِدْ فِيهِ بِإِلْحَادٍ بِظُلْمٍ\n(and whoever inclines to evil actions therein or to do wrong,) \"Hoarding (goods) in Makkah.\" This was also the view of others.\nوَمَن يُرِدْ فِيهِ بِإِلْحَادٍ بِظُلْمٍ\n(and whoever inclines to evil actions therein or to do wrong,) Ibn `Abbas said, \"This was revealed about `Abdullah bin Unays. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent him with two men, one of whom was a Muhajir and the other from among the Ansar. They began to boast about their lineages and `Abdullah bin Unays got angry and killed the Ansari. Then he reverted from Islam (became an apostate) and fled to Makkah. Then these words were revealed concerning him:\nوَمَن يُرِدْ فِيهِ بِإِلْحَادٍ بِظُلْمٍ\n(and whoever inclines to evil actions therein or to do wrong,) meaning, whoever flees to Al-Haram to do evil actions, i.e., by leaving Islam.\" These reports indicate some meanings of the phrase \"evil actions\", but the meaning is more general than that and includes things which are more serious. Hence when the owners of the Elephant planned to destroy the House (the Ka`bah), Allah sent against them birds in flocks,\nتَرْمِيهِم بِحِجَارَةٍ مِّن سِجِّيلٍ - فَجَعَلَهُمْ كَعَصْفٍ مَّأْكُولِ\n(Striking them with stones of Sijjil. And He made them like (an empty field of) stalks (of which the corn has been eaten up by cattle).) 105:4-5. means He destroyed them and made them a lesson and a warning for everyone who intends to commit evil actions there. Hence it was reported in a Hadith that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«يَغْزُو هَذَا الْبَيْتَ جَيْشٌ حَتَّى إِذَا كَانُوا بِبَيْدَاءَ مِنَ الْأَرْضِ خُسِفَ بِأَوَّلِهِمْ وَآخِرِهِم»\n(This House will be attacked by an army, then when they are in a wide open space, the first of them and the last of them will be swallowed up by the earth.)", "verse_meta": {"id": 2620}, "text_arabic_simple": "ان الذين كفروا ويصدون عن سبيل الله والمسجد الحرام الذي جعلناه للناس سواء العاكف فيه والباد ومن يرد فيه بالحاد بظلم نذقه من عذاب اليم ٢٥إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ وَيَصُدُّونَ عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلْمَسْجِدِ ٱلْحَرَامِ ٱلَّذِى جَعَلْنَـٰهُ لِلنَّاسِ سَوَآءً ٱلْعَـٰكِفُ فِيهِ وَٱلْبَادِ ۚ وَمَن يُرِدْ فِيهِ بِإِلْحَادٍۭ بِظُلْمٍۢ نُّذِقْهُ مِنْ عَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍۢ", "text_arabic_uthmani": "ان الذين كفروا ويصدون عن سبيل الله والمسجد الحرام الذي جعلناه للناس سواء العاكف فيه والباد ومن يرد فيه بالحاد بظلم نذقه من عذاب اليم", "fetched_at": 1761764786.4315462}

Then he recited this Ayah. The Hadith has already been quoted in our explanation of Surah Ibrahim. Allah gives another parable of the idolators in Surat Al-An`am, where He says:\nقُلْ أَنَدْعُواْ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ مَا لاَ يَنفَعُنَا وَلاَ يَضُرُّنَا وَنُرَدُّ عَلَى أَعْقَـبِنَا بَعْدَ إِذْ هَدَانَا اللَّهُ كَالَّذِى اسْتَهْوَتْهُ الشَّيَـطِينُ فِى الاٌّرْضِ حَيْرَانَ لَهُ أَصْحَـبٌ يَدْعُونَهُ إِلَى الْهُدَى ائْتِنَا قُلْ إِنَّ هُدَى اللَّهِ هُوَ الْهُدَى\n(Say: \"Shall we invoke others besides Allah, that can do us neither good nor can harm us, and shall we turn back on our heels after Allah has guided us -- like one whom the Shayaلtin have made to go astray in the land in confusion, his companions calling him to guidance (saying): `Come to us.\"' Say: \"Verily, Allah's guidance is the only guidance.\") 6:71", "verse_meta": {"id": 2626}, "text_arabic_simple": "ليشهدوا منافع لهم ويذكروا اسم الله في ايام معلومات على ما رزقهم من بهيمة الانعام فكلوا منها واطعموا البايس الفقير ٢٨ ثم ليقضوا تفثهم وليوفوا نذورهم وليطوفوا بالبيت العتيق ٢٩ ذالك ومن يعظم حرمات الله فهو خير له عند ربه واحلت لكم الانعام الا ما يتلى عليكم فاجتنبوا الرجس من الاوثان واجتنبوا قول الزور ٣٠ حنفاء لله غير مشركين به ومن يشرك بالله فكانما خر من السماء فتخطفه الطير او تهوي به الريح في مكان سحيق ٣١لِّيَشْهَدُوا۟ مَنَـٰفِعَ لَهُمْ وَيَذْكُرُوا۟ ٱسْمَ ٱللَّهِ فِىٓ أَيَّامٍۢ مَّعْلُومَـٰتٍ عَلَىٰ مَا رَزَقَهُم مِّنۢ بَهِيمَةِ ٱلْأَنْعَـٰمِ ۖ فَكُلُوا۟ مِنْهَا وَأَطْعِمُوا۟ ٱلْبَآئِسَ ٱلْفَقِيرَ ٢٨ ثُمَّ لْيَقْضُوا۟ تَفَثَهُمْ وَلْيُوفُوا۟ نُذُورَهُمْ وَلْيَطَّوَّفُوا۟ بِٱلْبَيْتِ ٱلْعَتِيقِ ٢٩ ذَٰلِكَ وَمَن يُعَظِّمْ حُرُمَـٰتِ ٱللَّهِ فَهُوَ خَيْرٌۭ لَّهُۥ عِندَ رَبِّهِۦ ۗ وَأُحِلَّتْ لَكُمُ ٱلْأَنْعَـٰمُ إِلَّا مَا يُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ ۖ فَٱجْتَنِبُوا۟ ٱلرِّجْسَ مِنَ ٱلْأَوْثَـٰنِ وَٱجْتَنِبُوا۟ قَوْلَ ٱلزُّورِ ٣٠ حُنَفَآءَ لِلَّهِ غَيْرَ مُشْرِكِينَ بِهِۦ ۚ وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِٱللَّهِ فَكَأَنَّمَا خَرَّ مِنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ فَتَخْطَفُهُ ٱلطَّيْرُ أَوْ تَهْوِى بِهِ ٱلرِّيحُ فِى مَكَانٍۢ سَحِيقٍۢ", "text_arabic_uthmani": "ليشهدوا منافع لهم ويذكروا اسم الله في ايام معلومات على ما رزقهم من بهيمة الانعام فكلوا منها واطعموا البايس الفقير ٢٨ ثم ليقضوا تفثهم وليوفوا نذورهم وليطوفوا بالبيت العتيق ٢٩ ذالك ومن يعظم حرمات الله فهو خير له عند ربه واحلت لكم الانعام الا ما يتلى عليكم فاجتنبوا الرجس من الاوثان واجتنبوا قول الزور ٣٠ حنفاء لله غير مشركين به ومن يشرك بالله فكانما خر من السماء فتخطفه الطير او تهوي به الريح في مكان سحيق", "fetched_at": 1761764794.285471}

O Allah, this is on behalf of me and anyone of my Ummah who has not offered a sacrifice.) This was recorded by Ahmad, Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi. Muhammad bin Ishaq recorded from Yazid bin Abi Habib from Ibn `Abbas that Jabir said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ sacrificed two rams on the day of `Id, and when he lay them down to sacrifice them, he said:</p><p>«وَجَّهْتُ وَجْهِيَ لِلَّذِي فَطَرَ السَّموَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ حَنِيفًا مُسْلِمًا وَمَا أَنَا مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ، إِنَّ صَلَاتِي وَنُسُكِي وَمَحْيَايَ وَمَمَاتِي للهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ، وَبِذَلِكَ أُمِرْتُ وَأَنَا أَوَّلُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ، اللَّهُمَّ مِنْكَ وَلَكَ عَنْ مُحَمَّدٍ وَأُمَّتِه»</p><p>(I turn my face to the One Who created the heavens and the earth, being true and sincere in faith submitting myself to Him Alone, and I am not of the idolators. Verily, my prayer, my sacrifice, my living and my dying are for Allah, the Lord of all that exists for, with no partner or associate for Him. Thus am I commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims. O Allah, from You and to You, on behalf of Muhammad and his Ummah.) Then he said, `Bismillah' and `Allahu Akbar' and slaughtered them.\" It was reported from `Ali bin Al-Husayn from Abu Rafi` that when the Messenger of Allah ﷺ wanted to offer a sacrifice, he would buy two fat, horned, fine rams. When he had prayed and addressed the people, he would bring one of them to where he was standing in the prayer place, and would sacrifice it himself with a knife, then he would say:</p><p>«اللَّهُمَّ هَذَا عَنْ أُمَّتِي جَمِيعِهَا: مَنْ شَهِدَ لَكَ بِالتَّوْحِيدِ وَشَهِدَ لِي بِالْبَلَاغ»</p><p>(O Allah, this is on behalf of all of my Ummah, whoever bears witness of Tawhid of You and bears witness that I have conveyed.) Then he would bring the other ram and sacrifice it himself, and say,</p><p>«هَذَا عَنْ مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِ مُحَمَّد»</p><p>(This is on behalf of Muhammad and the family of Muhammad.) He would give them to the poor and he and his family would eat from it as well. This was recorded by Ahmad and Ibn Majah. Al-A`mash narrated from Abu Zabiyan from Ibn `Abbas,</p><p>فَاذْكُرُواْ اسْمَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهَا صَوَآفَّ</p><p>(So mention the Name of Allah over them when they are drawn up in lines (for sacrifice). ) \"When they are standing on three legs, with the left foreleg tied up. He says Bismillah and Allahu Akbar, La ilaha illallah, Allahumma Minka wa Laka (In the Name of Allah and Allah is Most Great; there is no God but Allah. O Allah, from You and to You).\" In the Two Sahihs it was recorded that Ibn `Umar came to a man who had made his camel kneel down in order to sacrifice it. He said, \"Make it stand up fettered, (this is) the Sunnah of Abu Al-Qasim (i.e. the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ).\"</p><p>فَإِذَا وَجَبَتْ جُنُوبُهَا</p><p>(Then, when they are down on their sides,) Ibn Abi Najih reported that Mujahid said, \"This means, when it has fallen to the ground.\" This was narrated from Ibn `Abbas, and a similar view was narrated from Muqatil bin Hayyan. `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said,</p><p>فَإِذَا وَجَبَتْ جُنُوبُهَا</p><p>(Then, when they are down on their sides,) \"Meaning, when they have died.\" This is what was meant by the comment of Ibn `Abbas and Mujahid, for it is not permitted to eat from the sacrifice when it has been slaughtered until it has died and its movements have ceased. It was reported in a Marfu` Hadith:</p><p>«لَا تُعَجِّلُوا النُّفُوسَ أَنْ تَزْهَق»</p><p>(Do not rush until you are sure that the animal is dead. ) Ath-Thawri narrated in his Jami` that `Umar bin Al-Khattab said that, and he supported it with the Hadith of Shaddad bin `Aws in Sahih Muslim:</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ كَتَبَ الْإِحْسَانَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ فَإِذَا قَتَلْتُمْ فَأَحْسِنُوا الْقِتْلَةَ، وَإِذَا ذَبَحْتُمْ فَأَحْسِنُوا الذِّبْحَةَ، وَلْيُحِدَّ أَحَدُكُمْ شَفْرَتَهُ، وَلْيُرِحْ ذَبِيحَتَه»</p><p>(Allah has prescribed proficiency in all things. If you kill, kill well; and if you slaughter, slaughter well. Let each one of you sharpen his blade and let him spare suffering to the animal he slaughters.) It was recorded that Abu Waqid Al-Laythi said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«مَا قُطِعَ مِنَ الْبَهِيمَةِ وَهِيَ حَيَّةٌ فَهُوَ مَيْتَة»</p><p>(Whatever is cut from an animal while it is still alive is Maytah (dead flesh).) This was recorded by Ahmad, Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi, who graded it Sahih.</p><p>فَكُلُواْ مِنْهَا وَأَطْعِمُواْ الْقَـنِعَ وَالْمُعْتَرَّ</p><p>(eat thereof, and feed Qani` and the Mu`tarr...) This is a command which implies that this is permissible. Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Qani` is the one who is content with what he is given and he stays in his house, and the Mu`tarr is the one who comes to you and rubs shoulders with you so that you will give him some meat, but he does not ask for it. \" This was also the view of Mujahid and Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Qani` is the one who is too proud to ask, and Mu`tarr is the one who does ask.\" This was also the view of Qatadah, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i and Mujahid, according to one report narrated from him. And the opposite was also suggested. This Ayah has been quoted as evidence by those scholars who said that the sacrifice should be divided into three: a third for the one who offers the sacrifice to eat from, a third to be given as gifts to his friends, and a third to be given in charity to the poor, because Allah says:</p><p>فَكُلُواْ مِنْهَا وَأَطْعِمُواْ الْقَـنِعَ وَالْمُعْتَرَّ</p><p>(eat thereof, and feed the poor who does not ask, and the beggar who asks.) But there is no evidence in this Ayah for this view. According to a Sahih Hadith, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to the people: c</p><p>«إِنِّي كُنْتُ نَهَيْتُكُمْ عَنِ ادِّخَارِ لُحُومِ الْأَضَاحِي فَوْقَ ثَلَاثٍ، فَكُلُوا وَادَّخِرُوا مَا بَدَا لَكُم»</p><p>(I used to forbid you to keep the meat of the sacrifice for more than three days, but now eat from it and keep it as you see fit.) According to another report:</p><p>«فَكُلُوا وَادَّخِرُوا وَتَصَدَّقُوا»</p><p>(Eat some, keep some and give some in charity.) According to another report:</p><p>«فَكُلُوا وَأَطْعِمُوا وَتَصَدَّقُوا»</p><p>(Eat some, feed others, and give some in charity.) As for the animal skins, it was recorded in Musnad Ahmad from Qatadah bin An-Nu`man in the Hadith about the sacrifice:</p><p>«فَكُلُوا وَتَصَدَّقُوا، وَاسْتَمْتِعُوا بِجُلُودِهَا وَلَا تَبِيعُوهَا»</p><p>(Eat and give in charity, and make use of the skins, but do not sell them.) (Note) It was recorded that Al-Bara' bin `Azib said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«إِنَّ أَوَّلَ مَا نَبْدَأُ بِهِ فِي يَوْمِنَا هَذَا أَنْ نُصَلِّيَ، ثُمَّ نَرْجِعَ فَنَنْحَرَ، فَمَنْ فَعَلَ ذَلِكَ فَقَدْ أَصَابَ سُنَّتَنَا، وَمَنْ ذَبَحَ قَبْلَ الصَّلَاةِ فَإِنَّمَا هُوَ لَحْمٌ قَدَّمَهُ لِأَهْلِهِ لَيْسَ مِنَ النُّسُكِ فِي شَيْء»</p><p>(The first thing that we should do on this day of ours (`Id) is to pray, then we return and offer the sacrifice. Whoever does that will have followed our Sunnah. Whoever slaughters his animal before the prayer, this is just meat which he has brought for his family, it is not a sacrifice at all.) This was recorded by (Al-Bukhari and Muslim). And in Sahih Muslim, it is mentioned that one is not to offer the sacrifice until the Imam (leader) has offered his. It is prescribed to offer the sacrifice on the day of Nahr and the following three days of Tashriq, because of the Hadith of Jubayr bin Mut`im who said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:</p><p>«أَيَّامُ التَّشْرِيقِ كُلُّهَا ذَبْح»</p><p>(The days of Tashriq are all (for) sacrifice.)

Mujahid said: \"Al-Budn means camels.\" According to Muslim, Jabir bin `Abdullah and others said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ commanded us to share in offering the sacrifice, a Budn (camel) for seven people, and one cow for seven people.\"\nلَكُمْ فِيهَا خَيْرٌ\n(wherein you have much good. ) means, reward in the Hereafter.\nفَاذْكُرُواْ اسْمَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهَا صَوَآفَّ\n(So mention the Name of Allah over them when they are drawn up in lines (for sacrifice).) It was reported from Al-Muttalib bin `Abdullah bin Hantab that Jabir bin `Abdullah said, \"I prayed with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ on `Id Al-Adha. When he finished, he brought a ram and slaughtered it, saying,\n«بِاسْمِ اللهِ وَاللهُ أَكْبَرُ، اللَّهُمَّ هَذَا عَنِّي وَعَمَّنْ لَمْ يُضَحِّ مِنْ أُمَّتِي»\n(Bismillah, and Allahu Akbar. O Allah, this is on behalf of me and anyone of my Ummah who has not offered a sacrifice.) This was recorded by Ahmad, Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi. Muhammad bin Ishaq recorded from Yazid bin Abi Habib from Ibn `Abbas that Jabir said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ sacrificed two rams on the day of `Id, and when he lay them down to sacrifice them, he said:\n«وَجَّهْتُ وَجْهِيَ لِلَّذِي فَطَرَ السَّموَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ حَنِيفًا مُسْلِمًا وَمَا أَنَا مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ، إِنَّ صَلَاتِي وَنُسُكِي وَمَحْيَايَ وَمَمَاتِي للهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ، وَبِذَلِكَ أُمِرْتُ وَأَنَا أَوَّلُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ، اللَّهُمَّ مِنْكَ وَلَكَ عَنْ مُحَمَّدٍ وَأُمَّتِه»\n(I turn my face to the One Who created the heavens and the earth, being true and sincere in faith submitting myself to Him Alone, and I am not of the idolators. Verily, my prayer, my sacrifice, my living and my dying are for Allah, the Lord of all that exists for, with no partner or associate for Him. Thus am I commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims. O Allah, from You and to You, on behalf of Muhammad and his Ummah.) Then he said, `Bismillah' and `Allahu Akbar' and slaughtered them.\" It was reported from `Ali bin Al-Husayn from Abu Rafi` that when the Messenger of Allah ﷺ wanted to offer a sacrifice, he would buy two fat, horned, fine rams. When he had prayed and addressed the people, he would bring one of them to where he was standing in the prayer place, and would sacrifice it himself with a knife, then he would say:\n«اللَّهُمَّ هَذَا عَنْ أُمَّتِي جَمِيعِهَا: مَنْ شَهِدَ لَكَ بِالتَّوْحِيدِ وَشَهِدَ لِي بِالْبَلَاغ»\n(O Allah, this is on behalf of all of my Ummah, whoever bears witness of Tawhid of You and bears witness that I have conveyed.) Then he would bring the other ram and sacrifice it himself, and say,\n«هَذَا عَنْ مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِ مُحَمَّد»\n(This is on behalf of Muhammad and the family of Muhammad.) He would give them to the poor and he and his family would eat from it as well. This was recorded by Ahmad and Ibn Majah. Al-A`mash narrated from Abu Zabiyan from Ibn `Abbas,\nفَاذْكُرُواْ اسْمَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْهَا صَوَآفَّ\n(So mention the Name of Allah over them when they are drawn up in lines (for sacrifice). ) \"When they are standing on three legs, with the left foreleg tied up. He says Bismillah and Allahu Akbar, La ilaha illallah, Allahumma Minka wa Laka (In the Name of Allah and Allah is Most Great; there is no God but Allah. O Allah, from You and to You).\" In the Two Sahihs it was recorded that Ibn `Umar came to a man who had made his camel kneel down in order to sacrifice it. He said, \"Make it stand up fettered, (this is) the Sunnah of Abu Al-Qasim (i.e. the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ).\"\nفَإِذَا وَجَبَتْ جُنُوبُهَا\n(Then, when they are down on their sides,) Ibn Abi Najih reported that Mujahid said, \"This means, when it has fallen to the ground.\" This was narrated from Ibn `Abbas, and a similar view was narrated from Muqatil bin Hayyan. `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam said,\nفَإِذَا وَجَبَتْ جُنُوبُهَا\n(Then, when they are down on their sides,) \"Meaning, when they have died.\" This is what was meant by the comment of Ibn `Abbas and Mujahid, for it is not permitted to eat from the sacrifice when it has been slaughtered until it has died and its movements have ceased. It was reported in a Marfu` Hadith:\n«لَا تُعَجِّلُوا النُّفُوسَ أَنْ تَزْهَق»\n(Do not rush until you are sure that the animal is dead. ) Ath-Thawri narrated in his Jami` that `Umar bin Al-Khattab said that, and he supported it with the Hadith of Shaddad bin `Aws in Sahih Muslim:\n«إِنَّ اللهَ كَتَبَ الْإِحْسَانَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ فَإِذَا قَتَلْتُمْ فَأَحْسِنُوا الْقِتْلَةَ، وَإِذَا ذَبَحْتُمْ فَأَحْسِنُوا الذِّبْحَةَ، وَلْيُحِدَّ أَحَدُكُمْ شَفْرَتَهُ، وَلْيُرِحْ ذَبِيحَتَه»\n(Allah has prescribed proficiency in all things. If you kill, kill well; and if you slaughter, slaughter well. Let each one of you sharpen his blade and let him spare suffering to the animal he slaughters.) It was recorded that Abu Waqid Al-Laythi said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«مَا قُطِعَ مِنَ الْبَهِيمَةِ وَهِيَ حَيَّةٌ فَهُوَ مَيْتَة»\n(Whatever is cut from an animal while it is still alive is Maytah (dead flesh).) This was recorded by Ahmad, Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi, who graded it Sahih.\nفَكُلُواْ مِنْهَا وَأَطْعِمُواْ الْقَـنِعَ وَالْمُعْتَرَّ\n(eat thereof, and feed Qani` and the Mu`tarr...) This is a command which implies that this is permissible. Al-`Awfi reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Qani` is the one who is content with what he is given and he stays in his house, and the Mu`tarr is the one who comes to you and rubs shoulders with you so that you will give him some meat, but he does not ask for it. \" This was also the view of Mujahid and Muhammad bin Ka`b Al-Qurazi. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Qani` is the one who is too proud to ask, and Mu`tarr is the one who does ask.\" This was also the view of Qatadah, Ibrahim An-Nakha`i and Mujahid, according to one report narrated from him. And the opposite was also suggested. This Ayah has been quoted as evidence by those scholars who said that the sacrifice should be divided into three: a third for the one who offers the sacrifice to eat from, a third to be given as gifts to his friends, and a third to be given in charity to the poor, because Allah says:\nفَكُلُواْ مِنْهَا وَأَطْعِمُواْ الْقَـنِعَ وَالْمُعْتَرَّ\n(eat thereof, and feed the poor who does not ask, and the beggar who asks.) But there is no evidence in this Ayah for this view. According to a Sahih Hadith, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to the people: c\n«إِنِّي كُنْتُ نَهَيْتُكُمْ عَنِ ادِّخَارِ لُحُومِ الْأَضَاحِي فَوْقَ ثَلَاثٍ، فَكُلُوا وَادَّخِرُوا مَا بَدَا لَكُم»\n(I used to forbid you to keep the meat of the sacrifice for more than three days, but now eat from it and keep it as you see fit.) According to another report:\n«فَكُلُوا وَادَّخِرُوا وَتَصَدَّقُوا»\n(Eat some, keep some and give some in charity.) According to another report:\n«فَكُلُوا وَأَطْعِمُوا وَتَصَدَّقُوا»\n(Eat some, feed others, and give some in charity.) As for the animal skins, it was recorded in Musnad Ahmad from Qatadah bin An-Nu`man in the Hadith about the sacrifice:\n«فَكُلُوا وَتَصَدَّقُوا، وَاسْتَمْتِعُوا بِجُلُودِهَا وَلَا تَبِيعُوهَا»\n(Eat and give in charity, and make use of the skins, but do not sell them.) (Note) It was recorded that Al-Bara' bin `Azib said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«إِنَّ أَوَّلَ مَا نَبْدَأُ بِهِ فِي يَوْمِنَا هَذَا أَنْ نُصَلِّيَ، ثُمَّ نَرْجِعَ فَنَنْحَرَ، فَمَنْ فَعَلَ ذَلِكَ فَقَدْ أَصَابَ سُنَّتَنَا، وَمَنْ ذَبَحَ قَبْلَ الصَّلَاةِ فَإِنَّمَا هُوَ لَحْمٌ قَدَّمَهُ لِأَهْلِهِ لَيْسَ مِنَ النُّسُكِ فِي شَيْء»\n(The first thing that we should do on this day of ours (`Id) is to pray, then we return and offer the sacrifice. Whoever does that will have followed our Sunnah. Whoever slaughters his animal before the prayer, this is just meat which he has brought for his family, it is not a sacrifice at all.) This was recorded by (Al-Bukhari and Muslim). And in Sahih Muslim, it is mentioned that one is not to offer the sacrifice until the Imam (leader) has offered his. It is prescribed to offer the sacrifice on the day of Nahr and the following three days of Tashriq, because of the Hadith of Jubayr bin Mut`im who said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said:\n«أَيَّامُ التَّشْرِيقِ كُلُّهَا ذَبْح»\n(The days of Tashriq are all (for) sacrifice.)

Verily, His punishment is painful (and) severe.) 11:102 Then Allah says:\nفَكَأَيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ أَهْلَكْنَـهَا\n(And many a township did We destroy)\nوَهِىَ ظَـلِمَةٌ\n(while they were given wrongdoing,) meaning, they were rejecting their Messengers.\nفَهِىَ خَاوِيَةٌ عَلَى عُرُوشِهَا\n(so that it lie in ruins,) Ad-Dahhak said, \"Leveled to their roofs,\" i.e., their houses and cities were destroyed.\nوَبِئْرٍ مُّعَطَّلَةٍ\n(and (many) a deserted well) means, they draw no water from it, and no one comes to it, after it had been frequented often by crowds of people.\nوَقَصْرٍ مَّشِيدٍ\n(and a castle Mashid!) `Ikrimah said, \"This means whitened with plaster.\" Something similar was narrated from `Ali bin Abi Talib, Mujahid, `Ata', Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Al-Mulayh and Ad-Dahhak. Others said that it means high and impenetrable fortresses. All of these suggestions are close in meaning and do not contradict one another, for this sturdy construction and great height did not help their occupants or afford them any protection when the punishment of Allah came upon them, as He says:\nأَيْنَمَا تَكُونُواْ يُدْرِككُّمُ الْمَوْتُ وَلَوْ كُنتُمْ فِى بُرُوجٍ مُّشَيَّدَةٍ\n(\"Wheresoever you may be, death will overtake you even if you are in Buruj Mushayyadah!\") 4:78\nأَفَلَمْ يَسِيرُواْ فِى الاٌّرْضِ\n(Have they not traveled through the land,) means, have they not traveled in the physical sense and also used their minds to ponder That is sufficient, as Ibn Abi Ad-Dunya said in his book At-Tafakkur wal-I`tibar, \"Some of the wise people said, `Give life to your heart with lessons, illuminate it with thought, kill it with asceticism, strengthen it with certain faith, remind it of its mortality, make it aware of the calamities of this world, warn it of the disasters that life may bring, show it how things may suddenly change with the passing of days, tell it the stories of the people of the past, and remind it what happened to those who came before.\"' Walk through their ruins, see what they did and what became of them, meaning, look at the punishments and divine wrath that struck the nations of the past who belied,\nفَتَكُونَ لَهُمْ قُلُوبٌ يَعْقِلُونَ بِهَآ أَوْ ءَاذَانٌ يَسْمَعُونَ بِهَا\n(and have they hearts wherewith to understand and ears wherewith to hear) meaning, let them learn a lesson from that.\nفَإِنَّهَا لاَ تَعْمَى الاٌّبْصَـرُ وَلَـكِن تَعْمَى الْقُلُوبُ الَّتِى فِى الصُّدُورِ\n(Verily, it is not the eyes that grow blind, but it is the hearts which are in the breasts that grow blind.) means, the blind person is not the one whose eyes cannot see, but rather the one who has no insight. Even if the physical eyes are sound, they still cannot learn the lesson.\nوَيَسْتَعْجِلُونَكَ بِالْعَذَابِ وَلَن يُخْلِفَ اللَّهُ وَعْدَهُ وَإِنَّ يَوْماً عِندَ رَبِّكَ كَأَلْفِ سَنَةٍ مِّمَّا تَعُدُّونَ - وَكَأَيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ أَمْلَيْتُ لَهَا وَهِىَ ظَـلِمَةٌ ثُمَّ أَخَذْتُهَا وَإِلَىَّ الْمَصِيرُ\n(47.

This is like the Ayat:\nوَإِذْ قَالُواْ اللَّهُمَّ إِن كَانَ هَـذَا هُوَ الْحَقَّ مِنْ عِندِكَ فَأَمْطِرْ عَلَيْنَا حِجَارَةً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ أَوِ ائْتِنَا بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ\n(And (remember) when they said: \"O Allah! If this is indeed the truth from You, then rain down stones on us from the sky or bring on us a painful torment.\") 8:32 H\nوَقَالُواْ رَبَّنَا عَجِّل لَّنَا قِطَّنَا قَبْلَ يَوْمِ الْحِسَابِ\n(They say: \"Our Lord! Hasten to us Qittana (our punishment) before the Day of Reckoning!\") 38:16.\nوَلَن يُخْلِفَ اللَّهُ وَعْدَهُ\n(And Allah fails not His promise.) means, His promise to bring about the Hour and wreak vengeance upon His enemies, and to honor His close friends.\nوَإِنَّ يَوْماً عِندَ رَبِّكَ كَأَلْفِ سَنَةٍ مِّمَّا تَعُدُّونَ\n(And verily a day with your Lord is as a thousand years of what you reckon. ) means, He does not hasten, for what is counted as a thousand years with His creation is as one day with Him, and He knows that He is able to exact revenge and that He will not miss a thing, even if He delays and waits and postpones. Hence He then says:\nوَكَأَيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ أَمْلَيْتُ لَهَا وَهِىَ ظَـلِمَةٌ ثُمَّ أَخَذْتُهَا وَإِلَىَّ الْمَصِيرُ\n(And many a township did I give respite while it was given to wrongdoing.

Salman Al-Farisi, may Allah be pleased with him, passed by me and said, `I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say:\n«مَنْ مَاتَ مُرَابِطًا أَجْرَى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ مِثْلَ ذَلِكَ الْأَجْرِ، وَأَجْرَى عَلَيْهِ الرِّزْقَ، وَأَمِنَ مِنَ الفَتَّانِينَ، وَاقْرَؤُوا إِنْ شِئْتُمْ:\nوَالَّذِينَ هَاجَرُواْ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ ثُمَّ قُتِلُواْ أَوْ مَاتُواْ لَيَرْزُقَنَّهُمُ اللَّهُ رِزْقاً حَسَناً وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَهُوَ خَيْرُ الرَزِقِينَ - لَيُدْخِلَنَّهُمْ مُّدْخَلاً يَرْضَوْنَهُ وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَعَلِيمٌ حَلِيمٌ »\n(Whoever dies guarding the borders of Islam, Allah will give him a reward like that reward (of martyr) and will provide for him and keep him safe from trials. Recite, if you wish: (Those who emigrated in the cause of Allah and after that were killed or died, surely, Allah will provide a good provision for them. And verily, it is Allah Who indeed is the Best of those who make provision. Truly, He will make them enter an entrance with which they shall be well-pleased, and verily, Allah indeed is All-Knowing, Most Forbearing))\" He also recorded that `Abdur-Rahman bin Jahdam Al-Khawlani was with Fadalah bin `Ubayd when they accompanied with two funerals, at (an island of) sea one of whom had been struck by a catapult, and the other had passed away. Fadalah bin `Ubayd sat by the grave of the man who had passed away and someone said to him, \"Are you neglecting the martyr and not sitting by his grave\" He said, \"I would not mind which of these two graves Allah would resurrect me from, for Allah says:\nوَالَّذِينَ هَاجَرُواْ فِى سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ ثُمَّ قُتِلُواْ أَوْ مَاتُواْ لَيَرْزُقَنَّهُمُ اللَّهُ رِزْقاً حَسَناً\n(Those who emigrated in the cause of Allah and after that were killed or died, surely, Allah will provide a good provision for them.)\" And he recited these two Ayat, then said, \"What should I seek, O you servant, if I were to enter an entrance to His pleasure, and be provided good provisions By Allah, I would not mind which of these two graves Allah would resurrect me from.\"\nذلِكَ وَمَنْ عَاقَبَ بِمِثْلِ مَا عُوقِبَ بِهِ\n(That is so. And whoever has retaliated with the like of that which he was made to suffer....) Muqatil bin Hayan and Ibn Jurayj mentioned that this was revealed about a skirmish in which the Companions encountered some of the idolators. The Muslims urged them not to fight during the Sacred Months, but the idolators insisted on fighting and initiated the aggression. So the Muslims fought them and Allah granted them victory.\nإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَعَفُوٌّ غَفُورٌ\n(Verily, Allah indeed is Oft-Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving.)", "verse_meta": {"id": 2655}, "text_arabic_simple": "والذين هاجروا في سبيل الله ثم قتلوا او ماتوا ليرزقنهم الله رزقا حسنا وان الله لهو خير الرازقين ٥٨ ليدخلنهم مدخلا يرضونه وان الله لعليم حليم ٥٩ ۞ ذالك ومن عاقب بمثل ما عوقب به ثم بغي عليه لينصرنه الله ان الله لعفو غفور ٦٠وَٱلَّذِينَ هَاجَرُوا۟ فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ ثُمَّ قُتِلُوٓا۟ أَوْ مَاتُوا۟ لَيَرْزُقَنَّهُمُ ٱللَّهُ رِزْقًا حَسَنًۭا ۚ وَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَهُوَ خَيْرُ ٱلرَّٰزِقِينَ ٥٨ لَيُدْخِلَنَّهُم مُّدْخَلًۭا يَرْضَوْنَهُۥ ۗ وَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَعَلِيمٌ حَلِيمٌۭ ٥٩ ۞ ذَٰلِكَ وَمَنْ عَاقَبَ بِمِثْلِ مَا عُوقِبَ بِهِۦ ثُمَّ بُغِىَ عَلَيْهِ لَيَنصُرَنَّهُ ٱللَّهُ ۗ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَعَفُوٌّ غَفُورٌۭ", "text_arabic_uthmani": "والذين هاجروا في سبيل الله ثم قتلوا او ماتوا ليرزقنهم الله رزقا حسنا وان الله لهو خير الرازقين ٥٨ ليدخلنهم مدخلا يرضونه وان الله لعليم حليم ٥٩ ۞ ذالك ومن عاقب بمثل ما عوقب به ثم بغي عليه لينصرنه الله ان الله لعفو غفور", "fetched_at": 1761764832.75598}

So the Salah, which is the most important pillar of Islam after the two testimonies of faith, is obligatory, four Rak`ahs when one is settled, which are shortened to two Rak`ah when one is traveling. According to some Imams, only one Rak`ahs is obligatory at times of fear, as was recorded in the Hadith. A person may pray while walking or riding, facing the Qiblah or otherwise. When praying optional prayers while traveling, one may face the Qiblah or not. A person is not obliged to stand during the prayer if he is sick; the sick person may pray sitting down, and if he is not able to do that then he may pray lying on his side. And there are other exemptions and dispensations which may apply to the obligatory prayers and other duties.

Ibn `Abbas said concerning the Ayah,\nوَمَا جَعَلَ عَلَيْكمْ فِى الدِّينِ مِنْ حَرَجٍ\n(and has not laid upon you in religion any hardship), \"This means difficulty.\"\nمِّلَّةَ أَبِيكُمْ إِبْرَهِيمَ\n(It is the religion of your father Ibrahim. ) Ibn Jarir said, \"This refers back to the Ayah,\nوَمَا جَعَلَ عَلَيْكمْ فِى الدِّينِ مِنْ حَرَجٍ\n(and has not laid upon you in religion any hardship) meaning, any difficulty.\" On the contrary, He has made it easy for you, like the religion of your father Ibrahim. He said, \"It may be that it means: adhere to the religion of your father Ibrahim.\" I say: This interpretation of the Ayah is like the Ayah:\nقُلْ إِنَّنِى هَدَانِى رَبِّى إِلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ دِينًا قِيَمًا مِّلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفًا\n(Say: \"Truly, my Lord has guided me to a straight path, a right religion, the religion of Ibrahim, a Hanif) 6:161\nهُوَ سَمَّـكُمُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ مِن قَبْلُ وَفِى هَـذَا\n(He has named you Muslims both before and in this (Qur'an),) Imam `Abdullah bin Al-Mubarak said, narrating from Ibn Jurayj, from `Ata', from Ibn `Abbas: concerning Allah's saying,\nهُوَ سَمَّـكُمُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ مِن قَبْلُ\n(He has named you Muslims before) \"This refers to Allah, may He be glorified.\" This was also the view of Mujahid, `Ata', Ad-Dahhak, As-Suddi, Muqatil bin Hayyan and Qatadah. Mujahid said, \"Allah named you Muslims before, in the previous Books and in Adh-Dhikr,\nوَفِى هَـذَا\n(and in this) means, the Qur'an.\" This was also the view of others, because Allah says:\nهُوَ اجْتَبَـكُمْ وَمَا جَعَلَ عَلَيْكمْ فِى الدِّينِ مِنْ حَرَجٍ\n(He has chosen you, and has not laid upon you in religion any hardship) Then He urged them to follow the Message which His Messenger brought, by reminding them that this was the religion of their father Ibrahim. Then He mentioned His blessings to this Ummah, whereby He mentioned them and praised them long ago in the Books of the Prophets which were recited to the rabbis and monks. Allah says:\nهُوَ سَمَّـكُمُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ مِن قَبْلُ\n(He has named you Muslims both before) meaning, before the Qur'an,\nوَفِى هَـذَا\n(and in this.) Under the explanation of this Ayah, An-Nasa'i recorded from Al-Harith Al-Ash`ari from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, who said:\n«مَنْ دَعَا بِدَعْوَى الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ فَإِنَّهُ مِنْ جِثِيِّ جَهَنَّم»\n(Whoever adopts the call of Jahiliyyah, will be one of those who will crawl on their knees in Hell.) A man said, \"O Messenger of Allah, even if he fasts and performs Salah\" He said,\n«نَعَمْ وَإِنْ صَامَ وَصَلَّى ، فَادْعُوا بِدَعْوَةِ اللهِ الَّتِي سَمَّاكُمْ بِهَا الْمُسْلِمِينَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ عِبَادَ الله»\n(Yes, even if he fasts and performs Salah. So adopt the call of Allah whereby He called you Muslims and believers and servants of Allah.)\nلِيَكُونَ الرَّسُولُ شَهِيداً عَلَيْكُمْ وَتَكُونُواْ شُهَدَآءَ عَلَى النَّاسِ\n(that the Messenger may be a witness over you and you be witnesses over mankind!) means, `thus We have made you a just and fair nation, the best of nations, and all other nations will testify to your justice. On the Day of Resurrection you will be,\nشُهَدَآءَ عَلَى النَّاسِ\n(witnesses over mankind),' because on that Day all the nations will acknowledge its leadership and its precedence over all others. Therefore, on the Day of Resurrection the testimony of the members of this community will be accepted as proof that the Messengers ﷺ conveyed the Message of their Lord to them, and the Messenger will testify that he conveyed the Message to them.\nفَأَقِيمُواْ الصَّلوةَ وَءَاتُواْ الزَّكَوةَ\n(So perform the Salah, give Zakah) means, respond to this great blessing with gratitude by fulfilling your duties towards Allah, doing that which He has enjoined upon you and avoiding that which He had forbidden. Among the most important duties are establishing regular prayer and giving Zakah. Zakah is a form of beneficence towards Allah's creatures, whereby He has enjoined upon the rich to give a little of their wealth to the poor each year, to help the weak and needy. We have already mentioned its explanation in the Ayah of Zakah in Surat At-Tawbah (9:5).\nوَاعْتَصِمُواْ بِاللَّهِ\n(and hold fast to Allah.) means, seek the help and support of Allah and put your trust in Him, and get strength from Him.\nهُوَ مَوْلَـكُمْ\n(He is your Mawla,) meaning, He is your Protector and your Helper, He is the One Who will cause you to prevail against your enemies.\nفَنِعْمَ الْمَوْلَى وَنِعْمَ النَّصِيرُ\n(what an Excellent Mawla and what an Excellent Helper!) He is the best Mawla and the best Helper against your enemies. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat Al-Hajj. May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad ﷺ and his family and Companions, and grant them peace; may Allah honor and be pleased with the Companions and those who follow them in truth until the Day of Resurrection.", "verse_meta": {"id": 2673}, "text_arabic_simple": "يا ايها الذين امنوا اركعوا واسجدوا واعبدوا ربكم وافعلوا الخير لعلكم تفلحون ۩ ٧٧ وجاهدوا في الله حق جهاده هو اجتباكم وما جعل عليكم في الدين من حرج ملة ابيكم ابراهيم هو سماكم المسلمين من قبل وفي هاذا ليكون الرسول شهيدا عليكم وتكونوا شهداء على الناس فاقيموا الصلاة واتوا الزكاة واعتصموا بالله هو مولاكم فنعم المولى ونعم النصير ٧٨يَـٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ ٱرْكَعُوا۟ وَٱسْجُدُوا۟ وَٱعْبُدُوا۟ رَبَّكُمْ وَٱفْعَلُوا۟ ٱلْخَيْرَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ ۩ ٧٧ وَجَـٰهِدُوا۟ فِى ٱللَّهِ حَقَّ جِهَادِهِۦ ۚ هُوَ ٱجْتَبَىٰكُمْ وَمَا جَعَلَ عَلَيْكُمْ فِى ٱلدِّينِ مِنْ حَرَجٍۢ ۚ مِّلَّةَ أَبِيكُمْ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ ۚ هُوَ سَمَّىٰكُمُ ٱلْمُسْلِمِينَ مِن قَبْلُ وَفِى هَـٰذَا لِيَكُونَ ٱلرَّسُولُ شَهِيدًا عَلَيْكُمْ وَتَكُونُوا۟ شُهَدَآءَ عَلَى ٱلنَّاسِ ۚ فَأَقِيمُوا۟ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَءَاتُوا۟ ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ وَٱعْتَصِمُوا۟ بِٱللَّهِ هُوَ مَوْلَىٰكُمْ ۖ فَنِعْمَ ٱلْمَوْلَىٰ وَنِعْمَ ٱلنَّصِيرُ", "text_arabic_uthmani": "يا ايها الذين امنوا اركعوا واسجدوا واعبدوا ربكم وافعلوا الخير لعلكم تفلحون ۩ ٧٧ وجاهدوا في الله حق جهاده هو اجتباكم وما جعل عليكم في الدين من حرج ملة ابيكم ابراهيم هو سماكم المسلمين من قبل وفي هاذا ليكون الرسول شهيدا عليكم وتكونوا شهداء على الناس فاقيموا الصلاة واتوا الزكاة واعتصموا بالله هو مولاكم فنعم المولى ونعم النصير", "fetched_at": 1761764856.8194509}
