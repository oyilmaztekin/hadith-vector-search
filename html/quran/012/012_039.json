Prophet Yusuf explained to them next that it is because of their ignorance that they worship false deities and give them names, for these names were forged and are being transferred from one generation to the next generation. They have no proof or authority that supports this practice, hence his statement to them, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّآ أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ بِهَا مِن سُلْطَـنٍ</div><p>(for which Allah has sent down no authority) or proof and evidence. He then affirmed that the judgement, decision, will and kingdom are all for Allah alone, and He has commanded all of His servants to worship none but Him. He said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذلِكَ الدِّينُ الْقَيِّمُ</div><p>(that is the straight religion,) `this, Tawhid of Allah and directing all acts of worship at Him alone in sincerity, that I am calling you to is the right, straight religion that Allah has ordained and for which He has revealed what He wills of proofs and evidences,' </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَ النَّاسِ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(but most men know not.), and this is why most of them are idolators, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَآ أَكْثَرُ النَّاسِ وَلَوْ حَرَصْتَ بِمُؤْمِنِينَ </div><p>(And most of mankind will not believe even if you eagerly desire it.) 12:103 When Yusuf finished calling them, he started interpreting their dreams for them, </p>"
