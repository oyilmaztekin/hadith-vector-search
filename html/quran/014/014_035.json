    "text": "<h2>brahim's Supplication to Allah when He brought Isma`il to Makkah</h2><p>Allah mentions here, while bringing forth more evidences against Arab polytheists, that the Sacred House in Makkah was established on the worship of Allah alone, without partners. He also states that Ibrahim, who establsihed the city, has disowned those who worship others besides Allah, and that he begged Allah to make Makkah peaceful and secure,</p><p>رَبِّ اجْعَلْ هَـذَا الْبَلَدَ آمِنًا</p><p>(O my Lord! Make this city (Makkah) of peace and security,) and Allah accepted his supplication. Allah said in other Ayat,</p><p>أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّا جَعَلْنَا حَرَماً ءامِناً</p><p>(Have they not seen that We have made (Makkah) a secure sanctuary.) 29:67 and,</p><p>إِنَّ أَوَّلَ بَيْتٍ وُضِعَ لِلنَّاسِ لَلَّذِى بِبَكَّةَ مُبَارَكاً وَهُدًى لِّلْعَـلَمِينَ فِيهِ ءَايَـتٌ بَيِّـنَـتٌ مَّقَامُ إِبْرَهِيمَ وَمَن دَخَلَهُ كَانَ ءَامِناً</p><p>(Verily, the first House (of worship) appointed for mankind was that at Bakkah (Makkah), full of blessing, and a guidance for Al-'Alamin. In it are manifest signs, the Maqam of Ibrahim; whosoever enters it, he attains security.)3:96 Allah said here that Ibrahim supplicated,</p><p>رَبِّ اجْعَلْ هَـذَا الْبَلَدَ آمِنًا</p><p>(O my Lord! Make this city (Makkah) a of peace and security, ) saying, \"this city\", after he established it, and this is why he said afterwards,</p><p>الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ الَّذِى وَهَبَ لِى عَلَى الْكِبَرِ إِسْمَـعِيلَ وَإِسْحَـقَ</p><p>(All praise is due to Allah, Who has given me in old age Isma`il and Ishaq.) 14:39 It is well-known that Isma`il was thirteen years older than Ishaq. When Ibrahim took Isma`il and his mother to Makkah, while Isma`il was still young enough to nurse, he supplicated to Allah,</p><p>رَبِّ اجْعَلْ هَـذَا بَلَدًا آمِنًا</p><p>(O my Lord! Make this city (Makkah) a place of peace and security.) 2:126 as we in explained in Surat Al-Baqarah. Ibrahim then said,</p><p>وَاجْنُبْنِى وَبَنِىَّ أَن نَّعْبُدَ الاٌّصْنَامَ</p><p>(and keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols.) It is proper for whoever supplicates to Allah to also ask for the benefit of his parents and offspring, as well as himself. Ibrahim next mentioned that many among mankind were led astray because of idols, and he disowned those who worship them and referred their matter to Allah; if Allah wills, He will punish them, and if He wills, He will forgive them. `Isa, peace be upon him, said similar words,</p><p>إِن تُعَذِّبْهُمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ عِبَادُكَ وَإِن تَغْفِرْ لَهُمْ فَإِنَّكَ أَنتَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ</p><p>(If You punish them, they are Your servants, and if You forgive them, verily, You, only You are the Almighty, the All-Wise.)5:118 This supplication refers this and all matters to Allah, not that it is actually going to happen. `Abdullah bin `Amr narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited Ibrahim's supplication,</p><p>رَبِّ إِنَّهُنَّ أَضْلَلْنَ كَثِيرًا مِّنَ النَّاسِ</p><p>(O my Lord! They have indeed led astray many among mankind.), and the supplication of `Isa,</p><p>إِن تُعَذِّبْهُمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ عِبَادُكَ</p><p>(If You punish them, they are Your servants.) 5:118 then raised his hands and said,</p><p>«اللَّهُمَّ أُمَّتِي، اللَّهُمَّ أُمَّتِي، اللَّهُمَّ أُمَّتِي»</p><p>(O Allah, Save my Ummah! O, Allah, Save my Ummah! O, Allah, Save my Ummah!) and cried. Allah said to the angel Jibril, \"O Jibril, go to Muhammad ﷺ, and Your Lord has more knowledge, and ask him what makes him cry.\" Jibril came to the Prophet and asked him, and he repeated to him what he said (in his supplication). Allah said, \"Go to Muhammad ﷺ and tell him this; `We will make you pleased with your Ummah, O Muhammad, and will not treat them in a way you dislike.\"'</p>"
