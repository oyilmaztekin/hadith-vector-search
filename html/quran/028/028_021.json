Save me from the people who are wrongdoers!) means, from Fir`awn and his chiefs. It was mentioned that Allah sent to him an angel riding a horse, who showed him the way. And Allah knows best.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا تَوَجَّهَ تِلْقَآءَ مَدْيَنَ</div><p>(And when he went towards (the land of) Madyan,) means, he took a smooth and easy route -- and he rejoiced because of that.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ عَسَى رَبِّى أَن يَهْدِيَنِى سَوَآءَ السَّبِيلِ</div><p>(he said: \"It may be that my Lord guides me to the right way.\") meaning, the most straight route. And Allah did indeed do that, for He guided him to the straight path in this world and the Hereafter, and caused him to be guided and to guide others.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا وَرَدَ مَآءَ مَدْيَنَ</div><p>(And when he arrived at the water (a well) of Madyan,) means, when he reached Madyan and went to drink from its water, for it had a well where shepherds used to water their flocks,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَدَ عَلَيْهِ أُمَّةً مِّنَ النَّاسِ يَسْقُونَ وَوَجَدَ مِن دُونِهِمُ امْرَأَتَينِ تَذُودَانِ</div><p>(he found there a group of men watering, and besides them he found two women who were keeping back.) means, they were stopping their sheep from drinking with the sheep of those shepherds, lest some harm come to them. When Musa, peace be upon him, saw them, he felt sorry for them and took pity on them.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ مَا خَطْبُكُمَا</div><p>(He said: \"What is the matter with you\") meaning, `why do you not water your flocks with these people'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَتَا لاَ نَسْقِى حَتَّى يُصْدِرَ الرِّعَآءُ</div><p>(They said: \"We cannot water until the shepherds take...\") meaning, `we cannot water our flocks until they finish.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَبُونَا شَيْخٌ كَبِيرٌ</div><p>(And our father is a very old man.) means, `this is what has driven us to what you see.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَسَقَى لَهُمَا</div><p>(So he watered (their flocks) for them, )</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ تَوَلَّى إِلَى الظِّلِّ فَقَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّى لِمَآ أَنزَلْتَ إِلَىَّ مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَقِيرٌ</div><p>(then he turned back to shade, and said: \"My Lord! Truly, I am in need of whatever good that You bestow on me!\")</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلَى الظِّلِّ</div><p>(to shade,) Ibn `Abbas, Ibn Mas`ud and As-Suddi said: \"He sat beneath a tree.\" `Ata' bin As-Sa'ib said: \"When Musa said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبِّ إِنِّى لِمَآ أَنزَلْتَ إِلَىَّ مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَقِيرٌ</div><p>(\"My Lord!
