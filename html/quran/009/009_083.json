Allah mentioned the reason for this decision, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّكُمْ رَضِيتُمْ بِالْقُعُودِ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ</div><p>(\"You were pleased to sit (inactive) on the first occasion...\") Allah said in a similar Ayah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنُقَلِّبُ أَفْئِدَتَهُمْ وَأَبْصَـرَهُمْ كَمَا لَمْ يُؤْمِنُواْ بِهِ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ</div><p>(And We shall turn their hearts and their eyes away (from guidance), as they refused to believe therein for the first time. ) 6:110 The recompense of an evil deed includes being directed to follow it with another evil deed, while the reward of a good deed includes being directed to another good deed after it. For instance, Allah said concerning the `Umrah of Hudaybiyyah, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَيَقُولُ الْمُخَلَّفُونَ إِذَا انطَلَقْتُمْ إِلَى مَغَانِمَ لِتَأْخُذُوهَا</div><p>(Those who lagged behind will say, when you set forth to take the spoils.)48:15 Allah said next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاقْعُدُواْ مَعَ الْخَـلِفِينَ</div><p>(\"...then you sit (now) with those who lag behind.\") in reference to the men who lagged behind from Tabuk battle, according to Ibn `Abbas. </p>"
