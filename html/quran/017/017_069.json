Ibn `Abbas and others said, \"Al-Qasif is the wind of the sea which destroys vessels and sinks them.\"</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَيُغْرِقَكُم بِمَا كَفَرْتُمْ</div><p>(and drown you because of your disbelief) means because of your rejection and turning away from Allah.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ لاَ تَجِدُواْ لَكُمْ عَلَيْنَا بِهِ تَبِيعًا</div><p>(Then you will not find any avenger therein against Us.) Ibn `Abbas said that this means a helper. Mujahid said, \"A helper who will avenge you,\" i.e., take revenge on your behalf. Qatadah said it means, \"We are not afraid that anyone will pursue Us with anything of that nature (i.e., vengeance).\"</p>"
