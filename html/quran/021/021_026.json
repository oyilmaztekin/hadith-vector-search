    "text": "<h2>The Refutation of Those Who claim that the Angels are the Daughters of Allah; description of their Deeds and Status</h2><p>Here Allah refutes those who claim that He has offspring among the angels -- exalted and sanctified be He. Some of the Arabs believed that the angels were the daughters of Allah, but Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سُبْحَانَهُ بَلْ عِبَادٌ مُّكْرَمُونَ</div><p>(Glory to Him! They are but honored servants.) meaning, the angels are servants of Allah who are honored by Him and who hold high positions of noble status. They obey Him to the utmost in all their words and deeds.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ يَسْبِقُونَهُ بِالْقَوْلِ وَهُمْ بِأَمْرِهِ يَعْمَلُونَ </div><p>(They speak not until He has spoken, and they act on His command.) meaning, they do not initiate any matter before Him or go against His commands; on the contrary, they hasten to do as He commands, and He encompasses them with His knowledge so that nothing whatsoever is hidden from Him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ</div><p>(He knows what is before them, and what is behind them,)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَشْفَعُونَ إِلاَّ لِمَنِ ارْتَضَى</div><p>(and they cannot intercede except for him with whom He is pleased.) This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَن ذَا الَّذِى يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِهِ</div><p>(Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His permission) 2:255</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَنفَعُ الشَّفَـعَةُ عِندَهُ إِلاَّ لِمَنْ أَذِنَ لَهُ</div><p>(Intercession with Him profits not except for him whom He permits) 34:23. There are many Ayat which say similar things.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُمْ مِّنْ خَشْيَتِهِ</div><p>(And they for fear of Him) means, because they fear Him.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مُشْفِقُونَوَمَن يَقُلْ مِنْهُمْ إِنِّى إِلَـهٌ مِّن دُونِهِ</div><p>(And they stand in awe. And if any of them should say: \"Verily, I am a god besides Him,\") meaning, whoever claims to be a god instead of Allah, i.e., alongside Allah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَذلِكَ نَجْزِيهِ جَهَنَّمَ كَذَلِكَ نَجْزِى الظَّـلِمِينَ</div><p>(such We should recompense with Hell. Thus We recompense the wrongdoers.) meaning, everyone who says this. This is a conditional sentence, and the condition stated does not necessarily have to take place. This is like the Ayat:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلْ إِن كَانَ لِلرَّحْمَـنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَاْ أَوَّلُ الْعَـبِدِينَ </div><p>(Say: \"If the Most Gracious had a son, then I am the first of worshippers.\") 43:81</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَئِنْ أَشْرَكْتَ لَيَحْبَطَنَّ عَمَلُكَ وَلَتَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْخَـسِرِينَ</div><p>(If you join others in worship with Allah, (then) surely, (all) your deeds will be in vain, and you will certainly be among the losers.) 39:65</p>"
