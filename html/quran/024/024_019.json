    "text": "<h2>Disciplining Those Who like that Illegal Sexual Intercourse should be circulated among the Believers</h2><p>This is a third instance of discipline directed at those who hear evil talk, believe it to some extent, and start to spread it; they should not spread such talk or pass it on to others. Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يُحِبُّونَ أَن تَشِيعَ الْفَـحِشَةُ فِى الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ</div><p>(Verily, those who like that Fahshah should be circulated among those who believe, they will have a painful torment) meaning, those who like to see evil talk about them (the believers) appear,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ فِى الدُّنْيَا</div><p>(they will have a painful torment in this world) means, because of the prescribed punishment, and in the Hereafter because of the torment in Hell.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ وَأَنتُمْ لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ</div><p>(And Allah knows and you know not.) means, return the matter to Him and you will be guided. Imam Ahmad recorded from Thawban that the Prophet said:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«لَا تُؤْذُوا عِبَادَ اللهِ وَلَا تُعَيِّرُوهُمْ، وَلَا تَطْلُبُوا عَوْرَاتِهِمْ، فَإِنَّهُ مَنْ طَلَبَ عَوْرَةَ أَخِيهِ الْمُسْلِمِ طَلَبَ اللهُ عَوْرَتَهُ، حَتَّى يَفْضَحَهُ فِي بَيْتِهِ»</div><p>(Do not annoy the servants of Allah, nor abuse them, nor seek their hidden shortcomings. Whoever seeks out the faults of his Muslim brother, Allah will expose his faults and degrade him, even if he is hiding in his house.)</p>"
