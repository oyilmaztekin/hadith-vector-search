This is why the word for innovation - Bid`ah - comes from it, because it is something that did not have a precedence. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَنَّى يَكُونُ لَهُ وَلَدٌ وَلَمْ تَكُنْ لَّهُ صَـحِبَةٌ</div><p>(How can He have children when He has no wife) for the child is the offspring of two compatible spouses. Allah does not have an equal, none of His creatures are similar to Him, for He alone created the entire creation. Allah said; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَـنُ وَلَداً - لَقَدْ جِئْتُمْ شَيْئاً إِدّاً </div><p>(And they say: \"The Most Beneficent (Allah) has begotten a son.\" Indeed you have brought forth (said) a terrible evil thing.) 19:88-89, until, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكُلُّهُمْ ءَاتِيهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَـمَةِ فَرْداً </div><p>(And everyone of them will come to Him alone on the Day of Resurrection.)19:95. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَخَلَقَ كُلَّ شَىْءٍ وهُوَ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمٌ</div><p>(He created all things and He is the All-Knower of everything.) He has created everything and He is All-Knower of all things. How can He have a wife from His creation who is suitable for His majesty, when there is none like Him How can He have a child then Verily, Allah is Glorified above having a son. </p>"
