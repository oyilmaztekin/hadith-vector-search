The statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَلَوْ كُنَّا كَـرِهِينَ</div><p>(\"Even though we hate it\"), means, would you force us to do that, even though we hate what you are calling us to Certainly if we revert to your religion and accept your ways, we will have uttered a tremendous lie against Allah by calling partners as rivals to Him, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا يَكُونُ لَنَآ أَن نَّعُودَ فِيهَآ إِلاَ أَن يَشَآءَ اللَّهُ رَبُّنَا</div><p>(And it is not for us to return to it unless Allah, our Lord, should will.) This part of the Ayah refers all matters to Allah's will, and certainly, He has perfect knowledge of all matters and His observation encompasses all things, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَلَى اللَّهِ تَوَكَّلْنَا</div><p>(In Allah (Alone) we put our trust. ), concerning all our affairs, what we practice of them and what we ignore, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">رَبَّنَا افْتَحْ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَ قَوْمِنَا بِالْحَقِّ</div><p>(Our Lord! Judge between us and our people in truth) judge between us and our people and give us victory over them, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَنتَ خَيْرُ الْفَـتِحِينَ</div><p>(for You are the best of those who give judgment) and You are the Most Just Who never wrongs any in His judgment. </p>"
