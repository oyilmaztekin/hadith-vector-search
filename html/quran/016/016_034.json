For this reason Allah's punishment tormented them. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَحَاقَ بِهِم</div><p>(they were surrounded) meaning, they were overwhelmed by the painful torment. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا كَانُواْ بِهِ يَسْتَهْزِءُونَ</div><p>(by that which they used to mock.) meaning, they used to make fun of the Messengers when they warned them Allah's punishment, and for this it will be said to them on the Day of Resurrection: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَـذِهِ النَّارُ الَّتِى كُنتُم بِهَا تُكَذِّبُونَ </div><p>(This is the Fire which you used to belie.)
