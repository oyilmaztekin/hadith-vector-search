It has been said that he meant the prophethood. It has also been said that he meant the lawful provisions. It seems that the verse carries both meanings. Ath-Thawri said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَآ أُرِيدُ أَنْ أُخَالِفَكُمْ إِلَى مَآ أَنْهَـكُمْ عَنْهُ</div><p>(I wish not, in contradiction to you, to do that which I forbid you.) meaning, `do not forbid you from something and at the same time I contradict my prohibitions in secret behind your backs, doing what I have forbidden.' This is similar to what Qatadah said concerning Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَآ أُرِيدُ أَنْ أُخَالِفَكُمْ إِلَى مَآ أَنْهَـكُمْ عَنْهُ</div><p>(I wish not, in contradiction to you, to do that which I forbid you.) \"He is saying, `I do not forbid you all from something while I do it myself.\"' </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنْ أُرِيدُ إِلاَّ الإِصْلَـحَ مَا اسْتَطَعْتُ</div><p>(I only desire reform to the best of my power.) This means, \"In that which I command and forbid you, I only want to correct your affair as much as I am able.\" </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا تَوْفِيقِى</div><p>(And my guidance cannot come) This means, \"In whatever I intend that agrees with the truth.\" </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ بِاللَّهِ عَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْتُ</div><p>(except from Allah, in Him I put my trust) This means in all of my affairs. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِلَيْهِ أُنِيبُ</div><p>(and unto Him I repent.) meaning; \"I return.\" This has been said by Mujahid and others. </p>"
