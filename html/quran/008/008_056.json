    "text": "<h2>Striking Hard against Those Who disbelieve and break the Covenants</h2><p>Allah states here that the worst moving creatures on the face of the earth are those who disbelieve, who do not embrace the faith, and break promises whenever they make a covenant, even when they vow to keep them, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُمْ لاَ يَتَّقُونَ</div><p>(and they do not have Taqwa) meaning they do not fear Allah regarding any of the sins they commit. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِمَّا تَثْقَفَنَّهُمْ فِى الْحَرْبِ</div><p>(So if you gain the mastery over them in war), if you defeat them and have victory over them in war, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَشَرِّدْ بِهِم مَّنْ خَلْفَهُمْ</div><p>(then disperse those who are behind them,) by severely punishing the captured people according to Ibn `Abbas, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Ad-Dahhak, As-Suddi, `Ata' Al-Khurasani and Ibn `Uyaynah. This Ayah commands punishing them harshly and inflicting casualties on them. This way, other enemies, Arabs and non-Arabs, will be afraid and take a lesson from their end, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَعَلَّهُمْ يَذَّكَّرُونَ</div><p>(so that they may learn a lesson. ) </p><p>As-Suddi commented, \"They might be careful not to break treaties, so that they do not meet the same end.\" </p>"
