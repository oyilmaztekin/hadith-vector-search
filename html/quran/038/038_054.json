    "text": "<h2>The Final Return of the Blessed</h2><p>Allah tells us that His blessed, believing servants will have a good final return in the Hereafter, which means their ultimate destination. Then He explains it further, as He says: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">جَنَّـتِ عَدْنٍ</div><p>(`Adn Gardens) meaning, eternal gardens (of Paradise), </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مُّفَتَّحَةً لَّهُمُ الاٌّبْوَابُ</div><p>(whose doors will be opened for them.) means, when they come to them (these gardens), their gates will open for them. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مُّتَّكِئِينَ فِيهَا</div><p>(Therein they will recline;) It was said that this means that they will sit cross-legged on chairs beneath canopies. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَدْعُونَ فِيهَا بِفَـكِهَةٍ كَثِيرَةٍ</div><p>(therein they will call for fruits in abundance) means, whatever they ask for, they will find it, and it will be prepared just as they wanted it. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَشَرَابٌ</div><p>(and drinks;) means, whatever kind of drink they want, the servants will bring it to them, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِأَكْوَابٍ وَأَبَارِيقَ وَكَأْسٍ مِّن مَّعِينٍ </div><p>(With cups, and jugs, and a glass of flowing wine.) (56: 18). </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَعِندَهُمْ قَـصِرَتُ الطَّرْفِ</div><p>(And beside them will be Qasirat-at-Tarf (chaste females)) means, they restrain their glances from anyone except their husbands, and do not turn to anyone else. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَتْرَابٌ</div><p>((and) of equal ages.) means, they will all be of the same age. This is the understanding of Ibn `Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Muhammad bin Ka`b and As-Suddi. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هَـذَا مَا تُوعَدُونَ لِيَوْمِ الْحِسَابِ </div><p>(This it is what you are promised for the Day of Reckoning!) means, `this that We have mentioned of the features of Paradise is what He has prepared for His pious servants who will reach it after they have been resurrected from their graves and been saved from the Fire.' Then Allah tells us that Paradise will never come to an end or disappear or cease to be. He says: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ هَـذَا لَرِزْقُنَا مَا لَهُ مِن نَّفَادٍ </div><p>(Verily, this is Our provision which will never finish.) This is like the Ayat: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَا عِندَكُمْ يَنفَدُ وَمَا عِندَ اللَّهِ بَاقٍ</div><p>(Whatever is with you, will be exhausted, and whatever is with Allah will remain) (16:96). </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَطَآءً غَيْرَ مَجْذُوذٍ</div><p>(a gift without an end.) (11:108) </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَهُمْ أَجْرٌ غَيْرُ مَمْنُونٍ</div><p>(for them is a reward that will never come to an end.) (84:25). </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أُكُلُهَا دَآئِمٌ وِظِلُّهَا تِلْكَ عُقْبَى الَّذِينَ اتَّقَواْ وَّعُقْبَى الْكَـفِرِينَ النَّارُ</div><p>(its provision is eternal and so is its shade; this is the end of those who have Taqwa, and the end (final destination) of the disbelievers is Fire.)(13:35). And there are many similar Ayat. </p>"
