    "text": "<h2>Shaytan disowns His Followers on the Day of Resurrection</h2><p>Allah narrates to us what Iblis will say to his followers after Allah finishes with the judgement between His servants, sending the believers to the gardens of Paradise and the disbelievers to the lows (of the Fire). Iblis, may Allah curse him, will stand and address the latter, in order to add depression to their depression, sorrow to their sorrow and grief to their grief. He will declare,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ اللَّهَ وَعَدَكُمْ وَعْدَ الْحَقِّ</div><p>`(Verily, Allah promised you a promise of truth.) by the words of His Messengers that if you follow them, you will gain safety and deliverance. Truly, Allah's promise was true and correct news, while I promised you then betrayed you.' Allah said in another Ayah,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَعِدُهُمْ وَيُمَنِّيهِمْ وَمَا يَعِدُهُمْ الشَّيْطَـنُ إِلاَّ غُرُوراً </div><p>(He (Shaytan) makes promises to them, and arouses in them false desires; and Shaytan's promises are nothing but deceptions.) 4:120</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كَانَ لِىَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِّن سُلْطَـنٍ</div><p>(I had no authority over you) Shaytan will say, `I had no proof for what I called you to, nor evidence for what I promised you,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ أَن دَعَوْتُكُمْ فَاسْتَجَبْتُمْ لِى</div><p>(except that I called you, and you responded to me.) even though the Messengers establish the proof and unequivocal evidences against you and affirmed the truth of what they were sent to you with. But you disobeyed the Messengers and ended up earning this fate,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ تَلُومُونِى</div><p>(So blame me not,) today,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلُومُواْ أَنفُسَكُمْ</div><p>(but blame yourselves.), because it is your fault for defying the proofs and following me in the falsehood that I called you to.' Shaytan will say next,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">مَّآ أَنَاْ بِمُصْرِخِكُمْ</div><p>(I cannot help you), I cannot benefit, save, or deliver you from what you are suffering,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَآ أَنتُمْ بِمُصْرِخِىَّ</div><p>(nor can you help me.), nor can you save me and deliver me from the torment and punishment I am suffering,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنِّى كَفَرْتُ بِمَآ أَشْرَكْتُمُونِ مِن قَبْلُ</div><p>(I deny your former act of associating me (Shaytan) as a partner with Allah.) or because you associated me with Allah before,' according to Qatadah. Ibn Jarir commented; \"I deny being a partner with Allah, the Exalted and Most Honored.\" This opinion is the most plausible, for Allah said in other Ayat,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَنْ أَضَلُّ مِمَّن يَدْعُو مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ مَن لاَّ يَسْتَجِيبُ لَهُ إِلَى يَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ وَهُمْ عَن دُعَآئِهِمْ غَـفِلُونَ - وَإِذَا حُشِرَ النَّاسُ كَانُواْ لَهُمْ أَعْدَآءً وَكَانُواْ بِعِبَادَتِهِمْ كَـفِرِينَ </div><p>(And who is more astray than one who calls on others besides Allah, such as will not answer him till the Day of Resurrection, and who are (even) unaware of their calls to them And when mankind are gathered, they will become their enemies and will deny their worshipping.)46:5-6 and,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَلاَّ سَيَكْفُرُونَ بِعِبَـدَتِهِمْ وَيَكُونُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ ضِدّاً </div><p>(Nay, but they (the so-called gods) will deny their worship of them, and become opponents to them.)19:82 Allah said next,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الظَّـلِمِينَ</div><p>(Verily, the wrongdoers), who deviate from truth and follow falsehood, will earn a painful torment. It appears that this part of the Ayah narrates the speech that Shaytan will deliver to the people of the Fire after they enter it, as we stated. `Amir Ash-Sha`bi said, \"On the Day of Resurrection, two speakers will address the people. Allah the Exalted will say to `Isa, son of Maryam,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَءَنتَ قُلتَ لِلنَّاسِ اتَّخِذُونِى وَأُمِّىَ إِلَـهَيْنِ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ</div><p>(Did you say unto men: \"Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allah\") 5:116 until,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قَالَ اللَّهُ هَـذَا يَوْمُ يَنفَعُ الصَّـدِقِينَ صِدْقُهُمْ</div><p>(Allah will say: \"This is a Day on which the truthful will profit from their truth.\")5:119 Shaytan, may Allah curse him, will stand and address the people,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كَانَ لِىَ عَلَيْكُمْ مِّن سُلْطَـنٍ إِلاَّ أَن دَعَوْتُكُمْ فَاسْتَجَبْتُمْ لِى</div><p>(I had no authority over you except that I called you, and you responded to me.) Allah next mentioned the final destination of the miserable ones, who earned the disgrace and torment and having to listen to Shaytan address them, then He mentioned the final destination of the happy ones,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأُدْخِلَ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَاتِ جَنَّـتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الأَنْهَـرُ</div><p>(And those who believed and did righteous deeds, will be made to enter Gardens under which rivers flow,) wherever they wish them to flow and wherever they may be,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَآ</div><p>(to dwell therein for ever,) and will never transfer or be transferred from it,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِمْ تَحِيَّتُهُمْ فِيهَا سَلَـمٌ</div><p>(with the permission of their Lord. Their greeting therein will be: \"Salam (peace!). \") Allah said in other Ayat,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءُوهَا وَفُتِحَتْ أَبْوَبُهَا وَقَالَ لَهُمْ خَزَنَتُهَا سَلَـمٌ عَلَيْكُـمْ</div><p>(Till, when they reach it, and its gates will be opened and its keepers will say: \"Salamun `Alaykum (peace be upon you!)\") 39:73</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالمَلَـئِكَةُ يَدْخُلُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ مِّن كُلِّ بَابٍسَلَـمٌ عَلَيْكُمُ</div><p>(And angels shall enter unto them from every gate (saying): \"Salamun `Alaykum (peace be upon you!).\") 13:23-24</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيُلَقَّوْنَ فِيهَا تَحِيَّةً وَسَلَـماً</div><p>(Therein they shall be met with greetings and the word of peace and respect.) 25:75</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">دَعْوَهُمْ فِيهَا سُبْحَـنَكَ اللَّهُمَّ وَتَحِيَّتُهُمْ فِيهَا سَلاَمٌ وَءَاخِرُ دَعْوَاهُمْ أَنِ الْحَمْدُ للَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَـلَمِينَ </div><p>(Their way of request therein will be Subhanaka Allahumma (glory to you, O Allah) and Salam (peace!) will be their greetings therein (Paradise)! And the close of their request will be: Al-Hamdu Lillahi Rabbil-'Alamin all praise to Allah the Lord of that exists.)10:10</p>"
