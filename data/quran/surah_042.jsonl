Makkah is called Umm Al-Qura (the Mother of the Towns) because it is nobler than all other lands, as indicated by much evidence that has been discussed elsewhere.

On the Day when it comes, no person shall speak except by His leave. Some among them will be wretched and (others) blessed.) (11:103-105) Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ&nbsp; came out to us, holding two books in his hand. He said,</p><p>«أَتَدْرُونَ مَا هذَانِ الْكِتَابَانِ؟»</p><p>(Do you know what these two books are) We said, \"We do not know unless you tell us, O Messenger of Allah.\" Concerning the book in his right hand, He said:</p><p>«هَذَا كِتَابٌ مِنْ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ بِأَسْمَاءِ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ وَأَسْمَاءِ آبَائِهِمْ وَقَبَائِلِهِمْ، ثُمَّ أُجْمِلَ عَلى آخِرِهِمْ، لَا يُزَادُ فِيهِمْ وَلَا يُنْقَصُ مِنْهُمْ أبدًا»</p><p>(This is a book from the Lord of the worlds, containing the names of the people of Paradise and of their fathers and tribes; all of them are detailed, down to the last one of them, and nothing will be added or taken away from it.)

Then concerning the book in his left hand, he said:\n«هَذَا كِتَابُ أَهْلِ النَّارِ بِأَسْمَائِهِمْ وَأَسْمَاءِ آبَائِهِمْ وَقَبَائِلِهِمْ، ثُمَّ أُجْمِلَ عَلى آخِرِهِمْ، لَا يُزَادُ فِيهِمْ وَلَا يُنْقَصُ مِنْهُمْ أَبَدًا»\n(This is the book of the people of Hell, containing their names and the names of their fathers and tribes, all of them are detailed down to the last one of them, and nothing will be added or taken away from it.) The Companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ  said, \"Why should we strive if it is something that is already cut and dried\" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ  said:\n«سَدِّدُوا وَقَارِبُوا فَإِنَّ صَاحِبَ الْجَنَّةِ يُخْتَمُ لَهُ بِعَمَلِ أَهْلِ الْجَنَّةِ، وَإِنْ عَمِلَ أَيَّ عَمَلٍ،وَإِنَّ صَاحِبَ النَّارِ يُخْتَمُ لَهُ بِعَمَلِ أَهْلِ النَّارِ، وَإِنْ عَمِلَ أَيَّ عَمَل»\n(Strive with your deeds as hard as you can for middle course or close to it, for the person who is destined for Paradise will die doing the deeds of the people of Paradise, regardless of what he did before, and the person who is destined for Hell will die doing the deeds of the people of Hell, regardless of what he did before.) Then he made a gesture with his fist and said,\n«فَرَغَ رَبُّكُمْ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ مِنَ الْعِبَاد»\n(Your Lord has settled the matter of His servants) and he opened his right hand as if throwing something;\n«فَرِيقٌ فِي الْجَنَّة»\n(A party in Paradise.) and he made a similar gesture with his left hand;\n«فَرِيقٌ فِي السَّعِير»\n(And a party in the blazing Fire.)\" This was also recorded by At-Tirmidhi, and An-Nasa'i; At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Sahih Gharib.\" Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Nadrah said, \"One of the Companions of the Prophet , whose name was Abu Abdullah, was visited by some of his friends, and they found him weeping. They asked him, `What has caused you to weep Didn't the Messenger of Allah ﷺ  say to you,\n«خُذْ مِنْ شَارِبِكَ ثُمَّ أَقِرَّهُ حَتَّى تَلْقَانِي»\n(Trim your moustache and adhere to that practice until you meet me)' He said, `Yes, but I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say;\n«إِنَّ اللهَ تَعَالَى قَبَضَ بِيَمِينِهِ قَبْضَةً وَأُخْرَى بِالْيَدِ الْأُخْرَى، قَالَ: هذِهِ لِهذِهِ، وَهذِهِ لِهذِهِ، وَلَا أُبَالِي»\n(Allah picked up a handful in His Right Hand and another in His other Hand, and said, \"This is for this and this is for this, and I do not care.\") `And I do not know in which of the two handfuls I am.\"' There are several Hadiths about Al-Qadr (the Divine Decree) in the books of Sahih, Sunan and Musnad. Including those narrated by `Ali, Ibn Mas`ud, `A'ishah and a large number of Companions, may Allah be pleased with them all.\nوَلَوْ شَآءَ اللَّهُ لَجَعَلَهُمْ أُمَّةً وَحِدَةً\n(And if Allah had willed, He could have made them one nation,) means, either all following guidance or all following misguidance, but He made them all different, and He guides whomsoever He wills to the truth and He sends astray whomsoever He wills, and He has complete wisdom and perfect proof. Allah says:\nوَلَـكِن يُدْخِلُ مَن يَشَآءُ فِى رَحْمَتِهِ وَالظَّـلِمُونَ مَا لَهُمْ مِّن وَلِىٍّ وَلاَ نَصِيرٍ\n(but He admits whom He wills to His mercy.

The evidence for that is the fact that this Ayah is reinforced by the passage in Subhan (i.e., Surat Al-Isra') in which Allah says: y\nمَّن كَانَ يُرِيدُ الْعَـجِلَةَ عَجَّلْنَا لَهُ فِيهَا مَا نَشَآءُ لِمَن نُّرِيدُ ثُمَّ جَعَلْنَا لَهُ جَهَنَّمَ يَصْلَـهَا مَذْمُومًا مَّدْحُورًا - وَمَنْ أَرَادَ الاٌّخِرَةَ وَسَعَى لَهَا سَعْيَهَا وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَأُولَـئِكَ كَانَ سَعْيُهُم مَّشْكُورًا - كُلاًّ نُّمِدُّ هَـؤُلاءِ وَهَـؤُلاءِ مِنْ عَطَآءِ رَبِّكَ وَمَا كَانَ عَطَآءُ رَبِّكَ مَحْظُورًا - انظُرْ كَيْفَ فَضَّلْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ وَلَلاٌّخِرَةُ أَكْبَرُ دَرَجَـتٍ وَأَكْبَرُ تَفْضِيلاً\n(Whoever desires the quick-passing, We readily grant him what We will for whom We like. Then, afterwards, We have appointed for him Hell; he will (enter) burn therein disgraced and rejected. And whoever desires the Hereafter and strives for it, with the necessary effort due for it while he is a believer -- then such are the ones whose striving shall be appreciated. On each -- these as well as those -- We bestow from the bounties of your Lord. And the bounties of your Lord can never be forbidden. See how We prefer one above another (in this world), and verily, the Hereafter will be greater in degrees and greater in preferment.) (17:18-21) It was reported that Ubayy bin Ka`b, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ  said:\n«بَشِّرْ هذِهِ الْأُمَّةَ بِالسَّنَاءِ وَالرِّفْعَةِ وَالنَّصْرِ وَالتَّمْكِينِ فِي الْأَرْضِ، فَمَنْ عَمِلَ مِنْهُمْ عَمَلَ الْاخِرَةِ لِلدُّنْيَا، لَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ فِي الْاخِرَةِ مِنْ نَصِيب»\n(Give the glad tidings to this Ummah of sublimity, high status, victory and power in the land. But whoever among them does the deeds of the Hereafter for the sake of worldly gain, will have no portion of the Hereafter.)\"\nMaking Legislation for the Creatures is Shirk Allah says:\nأَمْ لَهُمْ شُرَكَاءُ شَرَعُواْ لَهُمْ مِّنَ الدِّينِ مَا لَمْ يَأْذَن بِهِ اللَّهُ\n(Or have they partners with Allah who have instituted for them a religion which Allah has not ordained) means, they do not follow what Allah has ordained for you of upright religion; on the contrary, they follow what their devils (Shayatin), of men and Jinn, have prescribed for them. They instituted taboos, such as the Bahirah, Sa'ibah, Wasilah or Ham. They also permitted eating flesh and blood of animals not slaughtered for consumption, gambling and other kinds of misguidance, ignorance and falsehood. These are things that they invented during Jahiliyyah, when they came up with all kinds of false rulings on what was permitted and what was forbidden, and false rites of worship and other corrupt ideas. It was recorded in the Sahih that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ  said:\n«رَأَيْتُ عَمْرَو بْنَ لُحَيِّ بْنِ قَمَعَةَ يَجُرُّ قُصْبَهُ فِي النَّار»\n(I saw `Amr bin Luhayy bin Qama`ah dragging his intestines in Hell) -- because he had been the first one to introduce the idea of the Sa'ibah. This man was one of the kings of the Khuza`ah tribe, and he was the first one to do these things. He was the one who had made the Quraysh worship idols, may the curse of Allah be upon him. Allah said:\nوَلَوْلاَ كَلِمَةُ الْفَصْلِ لَقُضِىَ بَيْنَهُمْ\n(And had it not been for a decisive Word, the matter would have been judged between them.) means, the punishment would have been hastened for them, were it not for the fact that it had already been decreed that it would be delayed until the Day of Resurrection.\nوَإِنَّ الظَّـلِمِينَ لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ\n(And verily, for the wrongdoers there is a painful torment.) i.e., an agonizing torment in Hell, what a terrible destination.\nThe Terror of the Idolators in the Place of Gathering\nتَرَى الظَّـلِمِينَ مُشْفِقِينَ مِمَّا كَسَبُواْ\n(You will see the wrongdoers fearful of that which they have earned,) means, in the arena of Resurrection.\nوَهُوَ وَاقِعٌ بِهِمْ\n(and it will surely befall them.) means, the thing that they fear will undoubtedly happen to them. This is how they will be on the Day of Resurrection; they will be in a state of utter fear and terror.\nوَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ فِى رَوْضَـتِ الْجَنَّـتِ لَهُمْ مَّا يَشَآءُونَ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ\n(But those who believe and do righteous deeds (will be) in the flowering meadows of the Gardens. They shall have whatsoever they desire with their Lord.) What comparison can there be between the former and the latter How can the one who will be in the arena of resurrection in a state of humiliation and fear, deserving it for his wrongdoing, be compared with the one who will be in the gardens of Paradise, enjoying whatever he wants of food, drink, clothing, dwellings, scenery, spouses and other delights such as no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and has never crossed the minds of men.

This is like the Ayah:\nإِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَظْلِمُ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ وَإِن تَكُ حَسَنَةً يُضَـعِفْهَا وَيُؤْتِ مِن لَّدُنْهُ أَجْراً عَظِيماً\n(Surely, Allah wrongs not even of the weight of a speck of dust, but if there is any good, He doubles it, and gives from Him a great reward.) (4:40)\nإِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ شَكُورٌ\n(Verily, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Ready to appreciate.) means, He forgives many bad deeds and increases a small amount of good deeds; He conceals and forgives sins and He multiplies and increases the reward of good deeds.\nThe Accusation that the Prophet fabricated the Qur'an -- and the Response to that\nAllah's saying;\nأَمْ يَقُولُونَ افْتَرَى عَلَى اللَّهِ كَذِباً فَإِن يَشَإِ اللَّهُ يَخْتِمْ عَلَى قَلْبِكَ\n(Or say they: \"He has invented a lie against Allah\" If Allah willed, He could have sealed up your heart.) means, `if you had invented any lies against Him, as these ignorant people claim,'\nيَخْتِمْ عَلَى قَلْبِكَ\n(He could have sealed up your heart.) means, `and thus caused you to forget what had already come to you of the Qur'an.'

(69:44-47) which means, `We would have wrought the utmost vengeance upon him, and no one among mankind would have been able to protect him.' And Allah said:\nوَيُحِقُّ الْحَقَّ بِكَلِمَـتِهِ\n(and establishes the truth by His Word.) means, He establishes it and strengthens it and makes it clear by His Words, i.e., by His evidence and signs.\nإِنَّهُ عَلِيمٌ بِذَاتِ الصُّدُورِ\n(Verily, He knows well what are in the breasts.) means, all that is hidden in the hearts of men.", "verse_meta": {"id": 4296}, "text_arabic_simple": "ذالك الذي يبشر الله عباده الذين امنوا وعملوا الصالحات قل لا اسالكم عليه اجرا الا المودة في القربى ومن يقترف حسنة نزد له فيها حسنا ان الله غفور شكور ٢٣ ام يقولون افترى على الله كذبا فان يشا الله يختم على قلبك ويمح الله الباطل ويحق الحق بكلماته انه عليم بذات الصدور ٢٤ذَٰلِكَ ٱلَّذِى يُبَشِّرُ ٱللَّهُ عِبَادَهُ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّـٰلِحَـٰتِ ۗ قُل لَّآ أَسْـَٔلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ أَجْرًا إِلَّا ٱلْمَوَدَّةَ فِى ٱلْقُرْبَىٰ ۗ وَمَن يَقْتَرِفْ حَسَنَةًۭ نَّزِدْ لَهُۥ فِيهَا حُسْنًا ۚ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌۭ شَكُورٌ ٢٣ أَمْ يَقُولُونَ ٱفْتَرَىٰ عَلَى ٱللَّهِ كَذِبًۭا ۖ فَإِن يَشَإِ ٱللَّهُ يَخْتِمْ عَلَىٰ قَلْبِكَ ۗ وَيَمْحُ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْبَـٰطِلَ وَيُحِقُّ ٱلْحَقَّ بِكَلِمَـٰتِهِۦٓ ۚ إِنَّهُۥ عَلِيمٌۢ بِذَاتِ ٱلصُّدُورِ", "text_arabic_uthmani": "ذالك الذي يبشر الله عباده الذين امنوا وعملوا الصالحات قل لا اسالكم عليه اجرا الا المودة في القربى ومن يقترف حسنة نزد له فيها حسنا ان الله غفور شكور ٢٣ ام يقولون افترى على الله كذبا فان يشا الله يختم على قلبك ويمح الله الباطل ويحق الحق بكلماته انه عليم بذات الصدور", "fetched_at": 1761804263.7257118}

Imam Ahmad recorded that Mu`awiyah bin Abi Sufyan, may Allah be pleased with him, said, \"I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say:\n«مَا مِنْ شَيْءٍ يُصِيبُ الْمُؤْمِنَ فِي جَسَدِهِ يُؤْذِيهِ إِلَّا كَفَّرَ اللهُ تَعَالَى عَنْهُ بِهِ مِنْ سَيِّئَاتِه»\n(No physical harm befalls a believer, but Allah will expiate for some of his sins because of it.)\" Imam Ahmad also recorded that `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said, \"The Messenger of Allah ﷺ  said:\n«إِذَا كَثُرَتْ ذُنُوبُ الْعَبْدِ وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ مَا يُكَفِّرُهَا، ابْتَلَاهُ اللهُ تَعَالَى بِالْحَزَنِ لِيُكَفِّرَهَا»\n(If a person commits many sins and has nothing that will expiate for them, Allah will test him with some grief that will expiate for them.)\"", "verse_meta": {"id": 4303}, "text_arabic_simple": "ومن اياته خلق السماوات والارض وما بث فيهما من دابة وهو على جمعهم اذا يشاء قدير ٢٩ وما اصابكم من مصيبة فبما كسبت ايديكم ويعفو عن كثير ٣٠ وما انتم بمعجزين في الارض وما لكم من دون الله من ولي ولا نصير ٣١وَمِنْ ءَايَـٰتِهِۦ خَلْقُ ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ وَمَا بَثَّ فِيهِمَا مِن دَآبَّةٍۢ ۚ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ جَمْعِهِمْ إِذَا يَشَآءُ قَدِيرٌۭ ٢٩ وَمَآ أَصَـٰبَكُم مِّن مُّصِيبَةٍۢ فَبِمَا كَسَبَتْ أَيْدِيكُمْ وَيَعْفُوا۟ عَن كَثِيرٍۢ ٣٠ وَمَآ أَنتُم بِمُعْجِزِينَ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ ۖ وَمَا لَكُم مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ مِن وَلِىٍّۢ وَلَا نَصِيرٍۢ", "text_arabic_uthmani": "ومن اياته خلق السماوات والارض وما بث فيهما من دابة وهو على جمعهم اذا يشاء قدير ٢٩ وما اصابكم من مصيبة فبما كسبت ايديكم ويعفو عن كثير ٣٠ وما انتم بمعجزين في الارض وما لكم من دون الله من ولي ولا نصير", "fetched_at": 1761804273.1810439}

And Allah says here:\nإِنْ عَلَيْكَ إِلاَّ الْبَلَـغُ\n(Your duty is to convey.) meaning, `all that We require you to do is to convey the Message of Allah to them.'\nوَإِنَّآ إِذَآ أَذَقْنَا الإِنسَـنَ مِنَّا رَحْمَةً فَرِحَ بِهَا\n(And verily, when We cause man to taste of mercy from Us, he rejoices there at;) means, when a time of ease and comfort comes to him, he is happy about it.\nوَإِن تُصِبْهُمْ\n(but when befalls them) means mankind.\nسَيِّئَةٌ\n(some evil) means, drought, punishment, tribulation or difficulty,\nفَإِنَّ الإِنسَـنَ كَفُورٌ\n(then verily, man (becomes) ingrate!) means, he forgets the previous times of ease and blessings and acknowledges nothing but the present moment. If times of ease come to him, he becomes arrogant and transgresses, but if any difficulty befalls him, he loses hope and is filled with despair. This is like what the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to the women:\n«يَا مَعْشَرَ النِّسَاءِ، تَصَدَّقْنَ، فَإِنِّي رَأَيْتُكُنَّ أَكْثَرَ أَهْلِ النَّار»\n)(O women, give in charity, for I have seen that you form the majority of the people of Hell.) A woman asked, \"Why is that, O Messenger of Allah\" He said:\n«لِأَنَّكُنَّ تُكْثِرْنَ الشِّكَايَةَ وَتَكْفُرْنَ الْعَشِيرَ، لَوْ أَحْسَنْتَ إِلى إِحْدَاهُنَّ الدَّهْرَ ثُمَّ تَرَكْتَ يَوْمًا، قَالَتْ: مَا رَأَيْتُ مِنْكَ خَيْرًا قَط»\n(Because you complain too much, and you are ungrateful to (your) husbands. If one of you were to be treated kindly for an entire lifetime, then that kindness was lacking for one day, she would say, `I have never seen anything good from you!') This is the case with most women, except for those whom Allah guides and who are among the people who believe and do righteous deeds. As the Prophet said, the believer is the one who:\n«إِنْ أَصَابَتْهُ سَرَّاءُ شَكَرَ، فَكَانَ خَيْرًا لَهُ، وَإِنْ أَصَابَتْهُ ضَرَّاءُ صَبَرَ، فَكَانَ خَيْرًا لَهُ، وَلَيْسَ ذَلِكَ لِأَحَدٍ إِلَّا لِلْمُؤْمِن»\n(... if something good happens to him, he is thankful, and that is good for him. If something bad happens to him, he bears it with patience, and that is good for him. This does not happen to anyone except the believer.)", "verse_meta": {"id": 4320}, "text_arabic_simple": "استجيبوا لربكم من قبل ان ياتي يوم لا مرد له من الله ما لكم من ملجا يوميذ وما لكم من نكير ٤٧ فان اعرضوا فما ارسلناك عليهم حفيظا ان عليك الا البلاغ وانا اذا اذقنا الانسان منا رحمة فرح بها وان تصبهم سيية بما قدمت ايديهم فان الانسان كفور ٤٨ٱسْتَجِيبُوا۟ لِرَبِّكُم مِّن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِىَ يَوْمٌۭ لَّا مَرَدَّ لَهُۥ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ ۚ مَا لَكُم مِّن مَّلْجَإٍۢ يَوْمَئِذٍۢ وَمَا لَكُم مِّن نَّكِيرٍۢ ٤٧ فَإِنْ أَعْرَضُوا۟ فَمَآ أَرْسَلْنَـٰكَ عَلَيْهِمْ حَفِيظًا ۖ إِنْ عَلَيْكَ إِلَّا ٱلْبَلَـٰغُ ۗ وَإِنَّآ إِذَآ أَذَقْنَا ٱلْإِنسَـٰنَ مِنَّا رَحْمَةًۭ فَرِحَ بِهَا ۖ وَإِن تُصِبْهُمْ سَيِّئَةٌۢ بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ فَإِنَّ ٱلْإِنسَـٰنَ كَفُورٌۭ", "text_arabic_uthmani": "استجيبوا لربكم من قبل ان ياتي يوم لا مرد له من الله ما لكم من ملجا يوميذ وما لكم من نكير ٤٧ فان اعرضوا فما ارسلناك عليهم حفيظا ان عليك الا البلاغ وانا اذا اذقنا الانسان منا رحمة فرح بها وان تصبهم سيية بما قدمت ايديهم فان الانسان كفور", "fetched_at": 1761804296.266386}
