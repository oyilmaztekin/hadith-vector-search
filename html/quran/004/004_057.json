    "text": "<h2>The Punishment of Those Who Disbelieve in Allah's Books and Messengers</h2><p>Allah describes the torment in the Fire of Jahannam for those who disbelieve in His Ayat and hinder from the path of His Messengers. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِـَايَـتِنَا</div><p>(Surely, those who disbelieved in Our Ayat ,) meaning, We will place them in the Fire which will encompass every part of their bodies. Allah then states that their punishment and torment are everlasting,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلَّمَا نَضِجَتْ جُلُودُهُمْ بَدَّلْنَـهُمْ جُلُوداً غَيْرَهَا لِيَذُوقُواْ الْعَذَابَ</div><p>(We shall burn them in Fire. As often as their skins are roasted through, We shall change them for other skins that they may taste the punishment). Al-A`mash said that Ibn `Umar said, \"When their skin are burned, they will be given another skin in replacement, and this skin will be as white as paper.\" This was collected by Ibn Abi Hatim, who also recorded that Al-Hasan said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلَّمَا نَضِجَتْ جُلُودُهُمْ</div><p>(As often as their skins are roasted through,) \"Their skin will be roasted through, seventy thousand times every day.\" Husayn said; Fudayl added that Hisham said that Al-Hasan also said that,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كُلَّمَا نَضِجَتْ جُلُودُهُمْ</div><p>(As often as their skins are roasted through, ) means, \"Whenever the Fire has roasted them through and consumed their flesh, they will be told, `Go back as you were before,' and they will.\"</p><h2>The Wealth of the Righteous; Paradise and its Joy</h2><p>Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ سَنُدْخِلُهُمْ جَنَّـتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَـرُ خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَداً</div><p>(But those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, We shall admit them to Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise), abiding therein forever.) describing the destination of the happy ones in the gardens of Eden, beneath which rivers flow in all of its areas, spaces and corners, wherever they desire and wish. They will reside in it for eternity, and they will not be transferred or removed from it, nor would they want to move from it. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَّهُمْ فِيهَآ أَزْوَجٌ مُّطَهَّرَةٌ</div><p>(Therein they shall have Azwajun Mutahharatun (purified mates),) free of menstruation, postnatal bleeding, filth, bad manners and shortcomings. Ibn `Abbas said that the Ayah means, \"They are purified of filth and foul things.\" Similar was said by `Ata', Al-Hasan, Ad-Dahhak, An-Nakha`i, Abu Salih, `Atiyah, and As-Suddi. Mujahid said that they are, free of urine, menstruation, spit, mucous and pregnancies.\" Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَنُدْخِلُهُمْ ظِـلاًّ ظَلِيلاً</div><p>(And We shall admit them to shades, wide and ever deepening (Paradise).) means, wide, extensive, pure and elegant shade. Ibn Jarir recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«إِنَّ فِي الْجَنَّةِ لَشَجَرَةً يَسِيرُ الرَّاكِبُ فِي ظِلِّهَا مِائَةَ عَامٍ لَا يَقْطَعُهَا: شَجَرَةَ الْخُلْد»</div><p>(There is a tree in Paradise, that if a rider travels under its shade for a hundred years, he will not cross it. It is the Tree of Everlasting Life.)</p>"
