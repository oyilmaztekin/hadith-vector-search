When a sheep would give birth to a male sheep, they would slaughter it and feed it to their males, but not to their females. If the newly born lamb was a female, they would not slaughter it, but if it was stillborn, they would share in it (with their females)! Allah forbade this practice.\" Similar was said by As-Suddi. Ash-Sha`bi said, \"The Bahirah's milk was only given to the men. But if any cattle from the Bahirah died, both men and women would share in eating it.\" Similar was said by `Ikrimah, Qatadah and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam. Mujahid commented; </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَقَالُواْ مَا فِى بُطُونِ هَـذِهِ الأَنْعَـمِ خَالِصَةٌ لِّذُكُورِنَا وَمُحَرَّمٌ عَلَى أَزْوَجِنَا</div><p>(And they say: \"What is in the bellies of such and such cattle is for our males alone, and forbidden to our females...\") \"It refers to the Sa'ibah and the Bahirah.\" Abu Al-`Aliyah, Mujahid and Qatadah said that Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَيَجْزِيهِمْ وَصْفَهُمْ</div><p>(He will punish them for their attribution. ) means, uttering such falsehood. This is explained by Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ تَقُولُواْ لِمَا تَصِفُ أَلْسِنَتُكُمُ الْكَذِبَ هَـذَا حَلَـلٌ وَهَـذَا حَرَامٌ لِّتَفْتَرُواْ عَلَى اللَّهِ الْكَذِبَ إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يَفْتَرُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ الْكَذِبَ لاَ يُفْلِحُونَ </div><p>(And say not concerning that which your tongues falsely utter: \"This is lawful and this is forbidden.\" so as to invent lies against Allah. Verily, those who invent lies against Allah will never prosper.) 16:116 Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ حَكِيمٌ</div><p>(Verily, He is All-Wise.) in His actions, statements, Law and decree, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَلِيمٌ</div><p>(All-Knower), in the actions of His servants, whether good or evil, and He will recompense them for these deeds completely. </p>"
