    "text": "<p>Allah says, the matter is not as you have wished and hoped it to be. Rather, whoever does an evil deed and abides purposefully in his error, coming on the Day of Resurrection with no good deeds, only evil deeds, then he will be among the people of the Fire.</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَاتِ</p><p>(And those who believe and do righteous good deeds) meaning, \"They believe in Allah and His Messenger and perform the good deeds that conform with the Islamic Law. They shall be among the people of Paradise.\" Allah said in a similar statement,</p><p>لَّيْسَ بِأَمَـنِيِّكُمْ وَلا أَمَانِىِّ أَهْلِ الْكِتَـبِ مَن يَعْمَلْ سُوءًا يُجْزَ بِهِ وَلاَ يَجِدْ لَهُ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ وَلِيّاً وَلاَ نَصِيراً - وَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِنَ الصَّـلِحَـتَ مِن ذَكَرٍ أَوْ أُنثَى وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَأُوْلَـئِكَ يَدْخُلُونَ الْجَنَّةَ وَلاَ يُظْلَمُونَ نَقِيراً</p><p>(It will not be in accordance with your desires (Muslims), nor those of the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), whosoever works evil, will have the recompense thereof, and he will not find any protector or helper besides Allah. And whoever does righteous good deeds, male or female, and is a (true) believer in the Oneness of Allah (Muslim), such will enter Paradise and not the least injustice, even the size of a Naqira (speck on the back of a date stone), will be done to them) (4: 123-124).</p><p>Also, Abu Hurayrah, Abu Wa'il, `Ata', and Al-Hasan said that,</p><p>وَأَحَـطَتْ بِهِ خَطِيـَـتُهُ</p><p>(And his sin has surrounded him) means, \"His Shirk (polytheism) has surrounded him.\" Also, Al-A`mash reported from Abu Razin that Ar-Rabi` bin Khuthaym said,</p><p>وَأَحَـطَتْ بِهِ خَطِيـَـتُهُ</p><p>(And his sin has surrounded him), \"Whoever dies before repenting from his wrongs.\" As-Suddi and Abu Razin said similarly. Abu Al-`Aliyah, Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Qatadah and Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said that,</p><p>وَأَحَـطَتْ بِهِ خَطِيـَـتُهُ</p><p>(And his sin has surrounded him) refers to major sins. All of these statements carry similar meanings, and Allah knows best.</p><h2>When Small Sins gather, They bring about Destruction</h2><p>Here we should mention the Hadith that Imam Ahmad recorded, in which `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِيَّاكُمْ وَمُحَقَّرَاتِ الذُّنُوبِ فَإِنَّهُنَّ يَجْتَمِعْنَ عَلَى الرَّجُلِ حَتّى يُهْلِكْنَه»</p><p>(Beware of the belittled sins, because they gather on a person until they destroy him.)</p><p>He then said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ gave them an example,</p><p>«كَمَثَلٍ قَوْمٍ نَزَلُوا بِأَرْضِ فَلَاةٍ، فَحَضَرَ صَنِيعُ الْقَوْمِ فَجَعَلَ الرَّجُلُ يَنْطَلِقُ فَيَجِيءُ بِالْعُودِ وَالرَّجُلُ يَجِيءُ بِالْعُودِ، حَتّى جَمَعُوا سَوَادًا وَأَجَّجُوا نَارًا فَأَنْضَجُوا مَا قَذَفُوا فِيهَا»</p><p>(This is the example of people who set up camp on a flat land, and then their servants came. One of them collected some wood and another man collected some wood until they collected a great deal. They then started a fire and cooked what they put on it.)</p><p>Muhammad bin Ishaq reported that Ibn `Abbas said that,</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَاتِ أُوْلَـئِكَ أَصْحَـبُ الْجَنَّةِ هُمْ فِيهَا خَـلِدُونَ</p><p>(And those who believe and do righteous good deeds, they are dwellers of Paradise, they will dwell therein forever) \"Whoever believes in what you (Jews) did not believe in and implements what you refrained from implementing of Muhammad's ﷺ religion, shall acquire Paradise for eternity. Allah stated that the recompense for good or evil works shall remain with its people for eternity. \"</p>"
