    "text": "<h2>Some Good Things were Forbidden for the Jews</h2><p>After mentioning that He has forbidden us to eat dead meat, blood, the flesh of swine, and any animal which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than Allah, and after making allowances for cases of necessity - which is part of making things easy for this Ummah, because Allah desires ease for us, not hardship - Allah then mentions what He forbade for the Jews in their laws before they were abrogated, and the restrictions, limitations and difficulties involved therein. He tells us: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَعَلَى الَّذِينَ هَادُواْ حَرَّمْنَا مَا قَصَصْنَا عَلَيْكَ مِن قَبْلُ</div><p>(And for those who are Jews, We have forbidden such things as We have mentioned to you before.) meaning in Surat Al-An`am, where Allah says: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَعَلَى الَّذِينَ هَادُواْ حَرَّمْنَا كُلَّ ذِى ظُفُرٍ وَمِنَ الْبَقَرِ وَالْغَنَمِ حَرَّمْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ شُحُومَهُمَآ إِلاَّ مَا حَمَلَتْ ظُهُورُهُمَآ</div><p>(And unto those who are Jews, We forbade every (animal) with undivided hoof, and We forbade them the fat of the ox and the sheep except what adheres to their backs) Until, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَصَـدِقُونَ</div><p>(We are indeed truthful) 6:146 Hence Allah says here: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا ظَلَمْنَـهُمْ</div><p>(And We did not wrong them,) meaning, in the restrictions that We imposed upon them. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَـكِن كَانُواْ أَنفُسَهُمْ يَظْلِمُونَ</div><p>(but they wronged themselves. ) meaning, they deserved that. This is like the Ayah: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَبِظُلْمٍ مِّنَ الَّذِينَ هَادُواْ حَرَّمْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ طَيِّبَـتٍ أُحِلَّتْ لَهُمْ وَبِصَدِّهِمْ عَن سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ كَثِيراً </div><p>(Because of the wrong committed of those who were Jews, We prohibited certain good foods which had been lawful for them - and (also) for their hindering many from Allah's way.) (4:160) Then Allah tells us, honoring and remin- ding believers who have sinned of His blessings, that who- ever among them repents, He will accept his repentance, as He says: </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ لِلَّذِينَ عَمِلُواْ السُّوءَ بِجَهَـلَةٍ</div><p>(Then, your Lord for those who did evil out of ignorance) Some of the Salaf said that this means that everyone who disobeys Allah is ignorant. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ تَابُواْ مِن بَعْدِ ذَلِكَ وَأَصْلَحُواْ</div><p>(and afterward repent and do righteous deeds) meaning, they give up the sins they used to commit and turn to doing acts of obedience to Allah. </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ رَبَّكَ مِن بَعْدِهَا</div><p>(verily, after that, your Lord is...) means, after that mistake </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَغَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</div><p>(...Pardoning, Most Merciful.) </p>"
