He is the All-Knowing Supreme Creator. Verily, His command, when He intends a thing, is only that He says to it, \"Be!\" and it is!) (36:81-82) And Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْاْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ الَّذِى خَلَقَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضَ قَادِرٌ عَلَى أَن يَخْلُقَ مِثْلَهُمْ</div><p>(See they not that Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth, is able to create the like of them.) meaning, on the Day of Resurrection, He will recreate and restore their bodies, as He created them in the first place.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَجَعَلَ لَهُمْ أَجَلاً لاَّ رَيْبَ فِيهِ</div><p>(And He has decreed for them an appointed term, whereof there is no doubt.) means, He has set a time for them to be re-created and brought forth from their graves, an appointed time which must surely come to pass. As Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا نُؤَخِّرُهُ إِلاَّ لاًّجَلٍ مَّعْدُودٍ </div><p>(And We delay it only for a term (already) fixed.) (11:104)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَبَى الظَّـلِمُونَ</div><p>(But the wrongdoers refuse) -- after the proof has been established against them,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِلاَّ كُفُورًا</div><p>((and accept nothing) but disbelief.) means, they persist in their falsehood and misguidance.</p>"
