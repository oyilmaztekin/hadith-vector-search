They lived after the people of `Ad, so Allah sent to them, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَخَاهُمْ صَـلِحاً</div><p>(their brother Salih.) He (Salih) commanded them to worship Allah alone. He said to them, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">هُوَ أَنشَأَكُمْ مِّنَ الاٌّرْضِ</div><p>(He brought you forth from the earth) This means: `He began your creation from it (the earth). From it He created your father, Adam.' </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَاسْتَعْمَرَكُمْ فِيهَا</div><p>(and settled you therein,) This means: `He made you prosperous in the earth. You are settled in it and you treasure it.' </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاسْتَغْفِرُوهُ</div><p>(then ask forgiveness) `This is in reference to your previous sins. ' </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ثُمَّ تُوبُواْ إِلَيْهِ</div><p>(and turn to Him in repentance.) `This is in reference to the future.' </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ رَبِّى قَرِيبٌ مُّجِيبٌ</div><p>(Certainly, my Lord is Near (to all by His knowledge), Responsive.) This is similar to Allah's statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِذَا سَأَلَكَ عِبَادِي عَنِّي فَإِنِّي قَرِيبٌ أُجِيبُ دَعْوَةَ الدَّاعِ إِذَا دَعَانِ</div><p>(And when My servants ask you concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed Near (to them by My knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me.) 2:186 </p>"
