    "text": "<h2>Allah is the Protector, Ruler and Creator</h2><p>Here Allah denounces the idolators for taking other gods instead of Allah, and declares that He is the True God, and it is not right to worship anyone except Him Alone. He is the One Who is able to bring the dead back to life and He is Able to do all things. Then He says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا اخْتَلَفْتُمْ فِيهِ مِن شَىْءٍ فَحُكْمُهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ</div><p>(And in whatsoever you differ, the decision thereof is with Allah.) means, in whatever issue you differ. This is general in meaning and applies to all things.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَحُكْمُهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ</div><p>(the decision thereof is with Allah.) means, He is the Judge of that, according to His Book and the Sunnah of His Prophet . This is like the Ayah:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِن تَنَازَعْتُمْ فِى شَىْءٍ فَرُدُّوهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَالرَّسُولِ</div><p>((And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allah and His Messenger) (4:59).</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">ذَلِكُمُ اللَّهُ رَبِّى</div><p>(Such is Allah, my Lord) means, (He is) the Judge of all things.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْتُ وَإِلَيْهِ أُنِيبُ</div><p>(in Whom I put my trust, and to Him I turn in repentance. ) means, `I refer all matters to Him.'</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَاطِرَ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ</div><p>(The Creator of the heavens and the earth.) means, the Maker of them both and everything in between.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">جَعَلَ لَكُمْ مِّنْ أَنفُسِكُمْ أَزْوَاجًا</div><p>(He has made for you mates from yourselves,) means, of your own kind. As a blessing and a favor from Him, He has made your kind male and female.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمِنَ الاٌّنْعَـمِ أَزْوجاً</div><p>(and for the cattle (also) mates.) means, and He has created for you eight pairs of cattle.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَذْرَؤُكُمْ فِيهِ</div><p>(By this means He creates you.) means, in this manner He creates you, male and female, generation after generation of men and cattle.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَىْءٌ</div><p>(There is nothing like Him,) means, there is nothing like the Creator of these pairs, for He is the Unique, the Self-Sufficient Master, Who has no peer or equal.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ</div><p>(He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.)</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَهُ مَقَـلِيدُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ</div><p>(To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth. ) We have already discussed the interpretation of this phrase in Surat Az-Zumar (39:63), the conclusion of which is that He is the One Who is controlling and governing them.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَبْسُطُ الرِّزْقَ لِمَنْ يَشَآءُ وَيَقَدِرُ</div><p>(He expands provision for whom He wills, and straitens.) means, He gives plentiful provision to whomsoever He wills and He reduces it for whomsoever He wills, and He is perfectly Wise and Just.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمٌ</div><p>(Verily, He is the All-Knower of everything.)</p>"
