    "text": "<h2>The gods of the Idolators did not witness the Creation of anything, not even Themselves</h2><p>Allah says: `These whom you take as helpers instead of Me are creatures just like you. They do not possess anything and did not witness the creation of heaven and earth, because they did not exist at that time.' Allah says, `I am the One Who independently and exclusively creates and controls all things, and I have no partner, associate or advisor in that.' As Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">قُلِ ادْعُواْ الَّذِينَ زَعَمْتُمْ مِّن دُونِ اللَّهِ لاَ يَمْلِكُونَ مِثُقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ فِى السَّمَـوَتِ وَلاَ فِى الاٌّرْضِ وَمَا لَهُمْ فِيهِمَا مِن شِرْكٍ وَمَا لَهُ مِنْهُمْ مِّن ظَهِيرٍ وَلاَ تَنفَعُ الشَّفَـعَةُ عِندَهُ إِلاَّ لِمَنْ أَذِنَ لَهُ</div><p>(Say: \"Call upon those you claim besides Allah, they possess not even a speck of dust in the heavens or on the earth, nor have they any share in either, nor is there for Him any assistant among them. Intercession with Him profits not except for him whom He permits.) 34:22-23 Similarly Allah says here:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَا كُنتُ مُتَّخِذَ الْمُضِلِّينَ عَضُداً</div><p>(nor did I take those who mislead as `Adudan.) Malik said: \"Assistants.\"</p>"
