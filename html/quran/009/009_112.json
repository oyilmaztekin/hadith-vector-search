Praising Allah is among the best statements. This is why Allah said next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الْحَـمِدُونَ</div><p>(who praise (Him)). Fasting is among the best actions, involving abstaining from the delights of food, drink and sexual intercourse, this is the meaning hereby, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">السَّـئِحُونَ</div><p>(As-Sa'ihun (who fast)) 9: 112. Allah also described the Prophet's wives that they are, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">سَـئِحَـتٍ</div><p>(Sa'ihat) 66:5, meaning, they fast. As for prostrating and bowing down, they are acts of the prayer, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الرَكِعُونَ السَّـجِدونَ</div><p>(who bow down, who prostrate themselves,) These believers also benefit Allah's creation and direct them to His obedience by ordaining righteousness and forbidding evil. They have knowledge about what should be performed and what should be shunned. This includes abiding by Allah's limits in knowledge and action, meaning, what He allowed and what He prohibited. Therefore, they worship the True Lord and advise creation. This is why Allah said next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَبَشِّرِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</div><p>(And give glad tidings to the believers.) since faith includes all of this, and the supreme success is for those who have faith. </p>"
