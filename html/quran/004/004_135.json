    "text": "<h2>Commanding Justice and Conveying the Witness for Allah</h2><p>Allah commands His believing servants to stand up for justice and fairness and not to deviate from it, right or left. They should not fear the blame of anyone or allow anyone to prevent them from doing something for the sake of Allah. They are also required to help, support and aid each other for Allah's sake. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">شُهَدَآءِ للَّهِ</div><p>(as witnesses to Allah) is similar to His statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَقِيمُواْ الشَّهَـدَةَ لِلَّهِ</div><p>(And establish the testimony for Allah). Testimony should be delivered precisely, for the sake of Allah, thus making the testimony correct, truly just, and free of alterations, changes or deletions. This is why Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَوْ عَلَى أَنفُسِكُمْ</div><p>(even though it be against yourselves,) meaning, give correct testimony, and say the truth when you are asked about it, even if harm will effect you as a consequence. Indeed, Allah shall make a way out and give relief for those who obey Him in every matter. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَوِ الْوَلِدَيْنِ وَالاٌّقْرَبِينَ</div><p>(or your parents, or your kin,) means, even if you have to testify against your parents and kin, do not compromise for their sake. Rather, give the correct and just witness even if they are harmed in the process, for the truth presides above everyone and is preferred to everyone. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِن يَكُنْ غَنِيّاً أَوْ فَقَيراً فَاللَّهُ أَوْلَى بِهِمَا</div><p>(be he rich or poor, Allah is a better Protector to both.) means, do not favor someone (in your testimony) because he is rich, or feel pity for him because he is poor, for Allah is their caretaker, a better Protector of them than you, and has better knowledge of what is good for them. Allah's statement,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَلاَ تَتَّبِعُواْ الْهَوَى أَن تَعْدِلُواْ</div><p>(So follow not the lusts, lest you may avoid justice;) means, let not desire, lust or the hatred you have against others, lure you into injustice in your affairs. Rather, stand for justice in all situations. Allah said;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلاَ يَجْرِمَنَّكُمْ شَنَآنُ قَوْمٍ عَلَى أَلاَّ تَعْدِلُواْ اعْدِلُواْ هُوَ أَقْرَبُ لِلتَّقْوَى</div><p>(And let not the enmity and hatred of others make you avoid justice. Be just: that is nearer to piety) when the Prophet sent `Abdullah bin Rawahah to collect the tax on the fruits and produce of the Jews of Khaybar, they offered him a bribe so that he would go easy on them. He said; \"By Allah! I have come to you from the dearest of the creation to me (Muhammad), and you are more hated by me than an equivelent number of apes and swine. However, my love for him (the Prophet ) and hatred for you shall not prevent me from being just with you.\" On that, they said, \"This (justice) is the basis which the heavens and earth were created. \" We will mention this Hadith later in Surat Al-Ma'idah (chapter 5) Allah willing. Allah's statement afterwards,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِن تَلْوُواْ أَوْ تُعْرِضُواْ</div><p>(and if you Talwu or Tu`ridu) means, \"Distort your testimony and change it\", according to Mujahid and several others among the Salaf. Talwu, includes distortion and intentional lying. For instance, Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِنَّ مِنْهُمْ لَفَرِيقًا يَلْوُونَ أَلْسِنَتَهُم بِالْكِتَـبِ</div><p>(And verily, among them is a party who Yalwuna (distort) the Book with their tongues (as they read)). Tu`ridu, includes hiding and withholding the testimony. Allah said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَمَن يَكْتُمْهَا فَإِنَّهُ ءَاثِمٌ قَلْبُهُ</div><p>(Who hides it, surely, his heart is sinful) The Prophet said,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">«خَيْرُ الشُّهَدَاءِ الَّذِي يَأْتِي بِشَهَادَتِهِ قَبْلَ أَنْ يُسْأَلَهَا»</div><p>(The best witness is he who discloses his testimony before being asked to do so.) Allah then warned,</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيراً</div><p>(Verily, Allah is Ever Well-Acquainted with what you do.) and will reward or punish you accordingly.</p>"
