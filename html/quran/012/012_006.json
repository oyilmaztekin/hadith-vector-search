    "text": "<h2>Interpretation of Yusuf's Vision</h2><p>Allah says that Ya`qub said to his son Yusuf, `Just as Allah chose you to see the eleven stars, the sun and the moon prostrate before you in a vision, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَكَذلِكَ يَجْتَبِيكَ رَبُّكَ</div><p>(Thus will your Lord choose you) designate and assign you to be a Prophet from Him, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيُعَلِّمُكَ مِن تَأْوِيلِ الاٌّحَادِيثِ</div><p>(and teach you the interpretation of Ahadith).' Mujahid and several other scholars said that this part of the Ayah is in reference to the interpreting of dreams. He said next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَيُتِمُّ نِعْمَتَهُ عَلَيْكَ</div><p>(and perfect His favor on you), `by His Message and revelation to you.' This is why Ya`qub said afterwards, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَمَآ أَتَمَّهَآ عَلَى أَبَوَيْكَ مِن قَبْلُ إِبْرَهِيمَ</div><p>(as He perfected it aforetime on your fathers, Ibrahim...), Allah's intimate friend, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَإِسْحَـقَ</div><p>(and Ishaq), Ibrahim's son, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">إِنَّ رَبَّكَ عَلِيمٌ حَكِيمٌ</div><p>(Verily, your Lord is All-Knowing, All-Wise.) Allah knows best whom to chose for His Messages. </p>"
