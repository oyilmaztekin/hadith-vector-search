    "text": "<h2>The Meaning of `Disease' in this Ayah</h2><p>As-Suddi narrated from Abu Malik and (also) from Abu Salih, from Ibn `Abbas, and (also) Murrah Al-Hamdani from Ibn Mas`ud and other Companions that this Ayah,</p><p>فِى قُلُوبِهِمْ مَّرَضٌ</p><p>(In their hearts is a disease) means, `doubt', and,</p><p>فَزَادَهُمُ اللَّهُ مَرَضًا</p><p>(And Allah has increased their disease) also means `doubt'. Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Abu Al-`Aliyah, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and Qatadah also said similarly. `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam commented on,</p><p>فِى قُلُوبِهِمْ مَّرَضٌ</p><p>(In their hearts is a disease), \"A disease in the religion, not a physical disease. They are the hypocrites and the disease is the doubt that they brought to Islam.</p><p>فَزَادَهُمُ اللَّهُ مَرَضًا</p><p>(And Allah has increased their disease) meaning, increased them in shameful behavior.\" He also recited,</p><p>فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ ءامَنُواْ فَزَادَتْهُمْ إِيمَـناً وَهُمْ يَسْتَبْشِرُونَوَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ فِى قُلُوبِهِم مَّرَضٌ فَزَادَتْهُمْ رِجْسًا إِلَى رِجْسِهِمْ</p><p>(As for those who believe, it has increased their faith, and they rejoice. But as for those in whose hearts is a disease, it will add disgrace to their disgrace.) (9:124-125) and commented, \"Evil to their evil and deviation to their deviation.\" This statement by `Abdur-Rahman is true, and it constitutes a punishment that is compatible to the sin, just as the earlier scholars stated. Similarly, Allah said,</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ اهْتَدَوْاْ زَادَهُمْ هُدًى وَءَاتَـهُمْ تَقُوَاهُمْ</p><p>(While as for those who accept guidance, He increases their guidance and grants them their piety) (47:17).</p><p>Allah said next,</p><p>بِمَا كَانُواْ يَكْذِبُونَ</p><p>(Because they used to tell lies). The hypocrites have two characteristics, they lie and they deny the Unseen.</p><p>The scholars who stated that the Prophet ﷺ knew the hypocrites of his time have only the Hadith of Hudhayfah bin Al-Yaman as evidence. In it the Prophet ﷺ gave him the names of fourteen hypocrites during the battle of Tabuk. These hypocrites plotted to assassinate the Prophet ﷺ during the night on a hill in that area. They planned to excite the Prophet's ﷺ camel, so that she would throw him down the hill. Allah informed the Prophet ﷺ about their plot, and the Prophet ﷺ told Hudhayfah their names.</p><p>As for the other hypocrites, Allah said about them,</p><p>وَمِمَّنْ حَوْلَكُم مِّنَ الاٌّعْرَابِ مُنَـفِقُونَ وَمِنْ أَهْلِ الْمَدِينَةِ مَرَدُواْ عَلَى النَّفَاقِ لاَ تَعْلَمُهُمْ نَحْنُ نَعْلَمُهُمْ</p><p>(And among the bedouins around you, some are hypocrites, and so are some among the people of Al-Madinah who persist in hypocrisy; you (O Muhammad ) know them not, We know them) (9:101), and,</p><p>لَّئِن لَّمْ يَنتَهِ الْمُنَـفِقُونَ وَالَّذِينَ فِى قُلُوبِهِمْ مَّرَضٌ وَالْمُرْجِفُونَ فِى الْمَدِينَةِ لَنُغْرِيَنَّكَ بِهِمْ ثُمَّ لاَ يُجَاوِرُونَكَ فِيهَآ إِلاَّ قَلِيلاً - مَّلْعُونِينَ أَيْنَمَا ثُقِفُواْ أُخِذُواْ وَقُتِّلُواْ تَقْتِيلاً</p><p>(If the hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is a disease, and those who spread false news among the people in Al-Madinah do not cease, We shall certainly let you overpower them, then they will not be able to stay in it as your neighbors but a little while. Accursed, they shall be seized wherever found, and killed with a (terrible) slaughter) (33:60-61).</p><p>These Ayat prove that the Prophet ﷺ was not informed about each and everyone among the hypocrites of his time. Rather, the Prophet ﷺ was only informed about their characteristics, and he used to assume that some people possessed these characteristics. Similarly, Allah said,</p><p>وَلَوْ نَشَآءُ لأَرَيْنَـكَهُمْ فَلَعَرَفْتَهُم بِسِيمَـهُمْ وَلَتَعْرِفَنَّهُمْ فِى لَحْنِ الْقَوْلِ</p><p>(Had We willed, We could have shown them to you, and you should have known them by their marks; but surely, you will know them by the tone of their speech!) (47:30).</p><p>The most notorious hypocrite at that time was `Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul; Zayd bin Arqam - the Companion - gave truthful testimony to that effect. In addition, `Umar bin Al-Khattab once mentioned the matter of Ibn Salul to the Prophet ﷺ, who said,</p><p>«إِنِّي أَكْرَهُ أَنْ تَتَحَدَّثَ الْعَرَبُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا يَقْتُلُ أَصْحَابَه»</p><p>(I would not like the Arabs to say to each other that Muhammad is killing his Companions.)</p><p>Yet, when Ibn Salul died, the Prophet ﷺ performed the funeral prayer for him and attended his funeral just as he used to do with other Muslims. It was recorded in the Sahih that the Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنِّي خُيِّرْتُ فَاخْتَرْت»</p><p>(I was given the choice (to pray for him or not), so I chose.)</p><p>In another narration, the Prophet ﷺ said,</p><p>«لَوْ أَعْلَمُ أَنِّي لَوْ زِدْتُ عَلَى السَّبْعِينَ يُغْفَرُ لَهُ لَزِدْت»</p><p>(If I knew that by asking (Allah to forgive Ibn Salul) more than seventy times that He would forgive him, then I would do that.)</p>"
