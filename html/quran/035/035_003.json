So Allah says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لاَ إِلَـهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ فَأَنَّى تُؤْفَكُونَ</div><p>(La ilaha illa Huwa. How then are you turning away (from Him)) meaning, `how can you turn away from Him after this has been made clear and this proof has been made obvious, but you still worship idols and false gods' And Allah knows best.</p>"
