    "text": "<div class=\"arabic uthmani\">لَئِنِ اتَّبَعْتُمْ شُعَيْبًا إِنَّكُمْ إِذاً لَّخَـسِرُونَ</div><p>(\"If you follow Shu`ayb, be sure then you will be the losers!\") Allah answered them, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَخَذَتْهُمُ الرَّجْفَةُ فَأَصْبَحُواْ فِي دَارِهِمْ جَـثِمِينَ </div><p>(So the earthquake seized them and they lay (dead), prostrate in their homes) Allah said that the earthquake shook them, as punishment for threatening to expel Shu`ayb and his followers. Allah mentioned their end again in Suah Hud, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَلَمَّا جَآءَ أَمْرُنَا نَجَّيْنَا شُعَيْبًا وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ مَعَهُ بِرَحْمَةٍ مِّنَّا وَأَخَذَتِ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ الصَّيْحَةُ فَأَصْبَحُواْ فِى دِيَـرِهِمْ جَـثِمِينَ </div><p>(And when Our commandment came, We saved Shu`ayb and those who believed with him by a mercy from Us. And the Sayhah (loud cry) seized the wrongdoers, and they lay (dead) prostrate in their homes.) 11:94 This Ayah mentions the Sayhah (cry) that struck them after they mocked Shu`ayb, saying, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">أَصَلَوَتُكَ تَأْمُرُكَ</div><p>(Does your Salah (prayer) command you...) so it was befitting to mention here the cry that made them silence. In Surat Ash-Shu`ara', Allah said, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَكَذَّبُوهُ فَأَخَذَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمِ الظُّلَّةِ إِنَّهُ كَانَ عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ </div><p>(But they belied him, so the torment of the Day of Shadow (a gloomy cloud) seized them. Indeed that was the torment of a Great Day) 26:189 because they challenged Shu`ayb, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَسْقِطْ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفاً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ</div><p>(\"So cause a piece of the heaven to fall on us, if you are of the truthful!\") 26:187. Therefore, Allah stated that each of these forms of punishment struck them on the Day of the Shadow. First, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَخَذَهُمْ عَذَابُ يَوْمِ الظُّلَّةِ</div><p>(So the torment of the Day of Shadow (a gloomy cloud) seized them) 26:189 when a gloomy cloud came over them (containing) fire, flames and a tremendous light. Next, a cry from the sky descended on them and a tremor shook them from beneath. Consequently, their souls were captured, their lives were taken and their bodies became idle, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">فَأَصْبَحُواْ فِي دَارِهِمْ جَـثِمِينَ</div><p>(and they lay (dead), prostrate in their homes). Allah said next, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">كَأَن لَّمْ يَغْنَوْاْ فِيهَآ</div><p>(They became as if they had never dwelt there) meaning, after the torment seized them, it looked as if they never dwelled in the land from which they wanted to expel their Messenger Shu`ayb and his followers. Here, Allah refuted their earlier statement, </p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">الَّذِينَ كَذَّبُواْ شُعَيْبًا كَانُواْ هُمُ الْخَـسِرِينَ</div><p>(Those who belied Shu`ayb, they were the losers.) </p>"
