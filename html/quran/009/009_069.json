    "text": "<p>بِخَلَـقِهِمْ</p><p>(their portion), means, they mocked their religion, according to Al-Hasan Al-Basri. Allah's statement,</p><p>وَخُضْتُمْ كَالَّذِي خَاضُواْ</p><p>(and you indulged in play and pastime as they indulged in play and pastime), indulged in lies and falsehood,</p><p>أُوْلَـئِكَ حَبِطَتْ أَعْمَـلُهُمْ</p><p>(Such are they whose deeds are in vain), their deeds are annulled; they will not acquire any rewards for them because they are invalid,</p><p>فِي الدنْيَا وَالاٌّخِرَةِ وَأُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْخَـسِرُونَ</p><p>(in this world and in the Hereafter. Such are they who are the losers.) because they will not acquire any rewards for their actions. Ibn `Abbas commented, \"How similar is this night to the last night,</p><p>كَالَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ</p><p>(Like those before you...) These are the Children of Israel, with whom we were compared. The Prophet said,</p><p>«وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَتَتَّبِعُنَّهُمْ حَتَّى لَوْ دَخَلَ الرَّجُلُ مِنْهُمْ جُحْرَ ضَبَ لَدَخَلْتُمُوه»</p><p>(By He in Whose Hand is my life! You will imitate them, and even if a man of them entered the den of a lizard, you will enter it likewise!)\" Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ لَتَتَّبِعُنَّ سَنَنَ الَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِكُمْ شِبْرًا بِشِبْرٍ وَذِرَاعًا بِذِرَاعٍ، وَبَاعًا بِبَاعٍ حَتَّى لَوْ دَخَلُوا جُحْرَ ضَبَ لَدَخَلْتُمُوه»</p><p>قالوا: ومن هم يا رسول الله، أهل الكتاب؟ قال:</p><p>«فَمَنْ؟»</p><p>(By He in Whose Hand is my soul! You will follow the traditions of those who were before you a hand span for a hand-span and forearm's length for forearm's length, and an arm's length for an arm's length. And even if they enter the den of a lizard, you will also enter it.) They asked, \"Who, O Allah's Messenger, the People of the Book\" He said, (Who else)\" This Hadith is similar to another Hadith collected in the Sahih.</p>"
