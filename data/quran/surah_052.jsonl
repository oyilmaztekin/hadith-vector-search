Al-Bukhari recorded that Umm Salamah said, \"I complained of being ill to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and he said,\n«طُوفِي مِنْ وَرَاءِ النَّاسِ وَأَنْتِ رَاكِبَة»\n(Perform Tawaf (of the Ka`bah) behind the crowd, while you are riding.)

At-Tur is the mount that has trees, similar to the mount where Allah spoke to Musa, while Musa was on it, and the mount on which Allah started the prophethood of `Isa. A mount that does not have trees is called Jabal, not Tur. Allah said,\nوَكِتَـبٍ مُّسْطُورٍ\n(And by the Book inscribed), it is said that it means Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz, (the Preserved Table). It is also said that is refers to the divinely revealed inscribed Books that people recite, and this is why Allah said,\nفِى رَقٍّ مَّنْشُورٍ - وَالْبَيْتِ الْمَعْمُورِ\n(In parchment unrolled. And by Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur.) In the Two Sahihs it is confirmed that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said in the Hadith about Al-Isra', after ascending to the seventh heaven:\n«ثُمَّ رُفِعَ بِي إِلَى الْبَيْتِ الْمَعْمُورِ، وَإِذَا هُوَ يَدْخُلُهُ كُلَّ يَوْمٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا، لَا يَعُودُونَ إِلَيْهِ آخِرَ مَا عَلَيْهِم»\n(Then, I was taken to Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur. It is visited every day by seventy thousand angels who will not come back to visit it again.) The angels worship Allah in Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur and perform Tawaf around it just as the people of the earth perform Tawaf around the Ka`bah. Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur is the Ka`bah of those who reside in the seventh heaven. During the Isra' journey, the Prophet saw Ibrahim Al-Khalil, who was reclining with his back on Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur. It was Ibrahim who built the Ka`bah on earth, and surely, the reward is compatible with the action. Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur is parallel to the Ka`bah; every heaven has its own house of worship, which is also the direction of prayer for its residents. The house that is located in the lower heaven, is called Bayt Al-`Izzah. And Allah knows best. The statement of Allah the Exalted,\nوَالسَّقْفِ الْمَرْفُوعِ\n(And by the roof raised high.) Sufyan Ath-Thawri, Shu`bah, and Abu Al-Ahwas, all narrated from Simak, from Khalid bin `Ar`arah, from `Ali bin Abi Talib:\nوَالسَّقْفِ الْمَرْفُوعِ\n(And by the roof raised high) \"Meaning the heaven.\" Sufyan added, \"Then `Ali recited,\nوَجَعَلْنَا السَّمَآءَ سَقْفاً مَّحْفُوظاً وَهُمْ عَنْ ءَايَـتِهَا مُعْرِضُونَ\n(And We have made the heaven a roof, safe and well-guarded.

It was also reported from Ibn `Abbas, and it is the view of Sa`id bin Jubayr, Mujahid, `Abdullah bin `Ubayd bin `Umayr and others. Qatadah said, \"Masjur is the `filled sea.\"' Ibn Jarir preferred this explanation saying, \"The sea is not lit with fire now, so it is filled.\" Allah's statement;\nإِنَّ عَذَابَ رَبِّكَ لَوَاقِعٌ\n(Verily, the torment of your Lord will surely come to pass.) contains the subject of the vow, indicating that His torment will surely strike the disbelievers, as Allah stated in another Ayah;\nمَّا لَهُ مِن دَافِعٍ\n(There is none that can avert it.) indicating that when Allah decides to send the torment upon them, none can prevent it or stop it from striking them. Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Ibn Abi Ad-Dunya recorded that Ja`far bin Zayd Al-`Abdi said, \"One night, in Al-Madinah, `Umar went out investigating the welfare of Muslims and passed by the house of a man who was standing in voluntary prayer. `Umar stood quietly, listening to his recitation; the man was reciting,\nوَالطُّورِ\n(By At-Tur), until he reached the Ayah,\nإِنَّ عَذَابَ رَبِّكَ لَوَاقِعٌ - مَّا لَهُ مِن دَافِعٍ\n(Verily, the torment of your Lord will surely come to pass.

Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Ibn Abi Ad-Dunya recorded that Ja`far bin Zayd Al-`Abdi said, \"One night, in Al-Madinah, `Umar went out investigating the welfare of Muslims and passed by the house of a man who was standing in voluntary prayer. `Umar stood quietly, listening to his recitation; the man was reciting,\nوَالطُّورِ\n(By At-Tur), until he reached the Ayah,\nإِنَّ عَذَابَ رَبِّكَ لَوَاقِعٌ - مَّا لَهُ مِن دَافِعٍ\n(Verily, the torment of your Lord will surely come to pass.

It is visited every day by seventy thousand angels who will not come back to visit it again.) The angels worship Allah in Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur and perform Tawaf around it just as the people of the earth perform Tawaf around the Ka`bah. Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur is the Ka`bah of those who reside in the seventh heaven. During the Isra' journey, the Prophet saw Ibrahim Al-Khalil, who was reclining with his back on Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur. It was Ibrahim who built the Ka`bah on earth, and surely, the reward is compatible with the action. Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur is parallel to the Ka`bah; every heaven has its own house of worship, which is also the direction of prayer for its residents. The house that is located in the lower heaven, is called Bayt Al-`Izzah. And Allah knows best. The statement of Allah the Exalted,</p><p>وَالسَّقْفِ الْمَرْفُوعِ</p><p>(And by the roof raised high.) Sufyan Ath-Thawri, Shu`bah, and Abu Al-Ahwas, all narrated from Simak, from Khalid bin `Ar`arah, from `Ali bin Abi Talib:</p><p>وَالسَّقْفِ الْمَرْفُوعِ</p><p>(And by the roof raised high) \"Meaning the heaven.\" Sufyan added, \"Then `Ali recited,</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَا السَّمَآءَ سَقْفاً مَّحْفُوظاً وَهُمْ عَنْ ءَايَـتِهَا مُعْرِضُونَ</p><p>(And We have made the heaven a roof, safe and well-guarded.

At-Tur is the mount that has trees, similar to the mount where Allah spoke to Musa, while Musa was on it, and the mount on which Allah started the prophethood of `Isa. A mount that does not have trees is called Jabal, not Tur. Allah said,\nوَكِتَـبٍ مُّسْطُورٍ\n(And by the Book inscribed), it is said that it means Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz, (the Preserved Table). It is also said that is refers to the divinely revealed inscribed Books that people recite, and this is why Allah said,\nفِى رَقٍّ مَّنْشُورٍ - وَالْبَيْتِ الْمَعْمُورِ\n(In parchment unrolled. And by Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur.) In the Two Sahihs it is confirmed that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said in the Hadith about Al-Isra', after ascending to the seventh heaven:\n«ثُمَّ رُفِعَ بِي إِلَى الْبَيْتِ الْمَعْمُورِ، وَإِذَا هُوَ يَدْخُلُهُ كُلَّ يَوْمٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا، لَا يَعُودُونَ إِلَيْهِ آخِرَ مَا عَلَيْهِم»\n(Then, I was taken to Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur. It is visited every day by seventy thousand angels who will not come back to visit it again.) The angels worship Allah in Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur and perform Tawaf around it just as the people of the earth perform Tawaf around the Ka`bah. Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur is the Ka`bah of those who reside in the seventh heaven. During the Isra' journey, the Prophet saw Ibrahim Al-Khalil, who was reclining with his back on Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur. It was Ibrahim who built the Ka`bah on earth, and surely, the reward is compatible with the action. Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur is parallel to the Ka`bah; every heaven has its own house of worship, which is also the direction of prayer for its residents. The house that is located in the lower heaven, is called Bayt Al-`Izzah. And Allah knows best. The statement of Allah the Exalted,\nوَالسَّقْفِ الْمَرْفُوعِ\n(And by the roof raised high.) Sufyan Ath-Thawri, Shu`bah, and Abu Al-Ahwas, all narrated from Simak, from Khalid bin `Ar`arah, from `Ali bin Abi Talib:\nوَالسَّقْفِ الْمَرْفُوعِ\n(And by the roof raised high) \"Meaning the heaven.\" Sufyan added, \"Then `Ali recited,\nوَجَعَلْنَا السَّمَآءَ سَقْفاً مَّحْفُوظاً وَهُمْ عَنْ ءَايَـتِهَا مُعْرِضُونَ\n(And We have made the heaven a roof, safe and well-guarded. Yet they turn away from its signs.)(21:32)\" Similar was said by Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ibn Jurayj, Ibn Zayd and preferred by Ibn Jarir. The statement of Allah the Exalted,\nوَالْبَحْرِ الْمَسْجُورِ\n(And by the sea that is Masjur.) The majority say it refers to the oceans of the earth. Masjur, means, the sea will be kindled with fire on the Day of Resurrection just as Allah said in another Ayah,\nوَإِذَا الْبِحَارُ سُجِّرَتْ\n(And when the seas become as blazing fire.)(81:6) i.e., it will be kindled with fire and become a raging fire that surrounds the people in the gathering area, this was reported by Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib from `Ali bin Abi Talib. It was also reported from Ibn `Abbas, and it is the view of Sa`id bin Jubayr, Mujahid, `Abdullah bin `Ubayd bin `Umayr and others. Qatadah said, \"Masjur is the `filled sea.\"' Ibn Jarir preferred this explanation saying, \"The sea is not lit with fire now, so it is filled.\" Allah's statement;\nإِنَّ عَذَابَ رَبِّكَ لَوَاقِعٌ\n(Verily, the torment of your Lord will surely come to pass.) contains the subject of the vow, indicating that His torment will surely strike the disbelievers, as Allah stated in another Ayah;\nمَّا لَهُ مِن دَافِعٍ\n(There is none that can avert it.) indicating that when Allah decides to send the torment upon them, none can prevent it or stop it from striking them. Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Ibn Abi Ad-Dunya recorded that Ja`far bin Zayd Al-`Abdi said, \"One night, in Al-Madinah, `Umar went out investigating the welfare of Muslims and passed by the house of a man who was standing in voluntary prayer. `Umar stood quietly, listening to his recitation; the man was reciting,\nوَالطُّورِ\n(By At-Tur), until he reached the Ayah,\nإِنَّ عَذَابَ رَبِّكَ لَوَاقِعٌ - مَّا لَهُ مِن دَافِعٍ\n(Verily, the torment of your Lord will surely come to pass. There is none that can avert it.) `Umar said, `By the Lord of the Ka`bah, this is a true vow.' `Umar dismounted his donkey and sat next to a wall for a while. He then went back to his house and fell ill for a month. During his illness, the people would visit him, not knowing what caused his illness.\" May Allah be pleased with `Umar.\nDescribing the Day of Torment, the Day of Resurrection\nAllah said;\nيَوْمَ تَمُورُ السَّمَآءُ مَوْراً\n(On the Day when Tamur the heaven Mawr) Ibn `Abbas and Qatadah said: \"Shaking violently.\" Also from Ibn `Abbas, \"Split.\" Mujahid said: \"Spin violently.\" Ad-Dahhak commented on the Ayah, saying, \"The earth will violently spin and move by the command of Allah, and its areas will violently move towards each other.\" This was preferred by Ibn Jarir, because of the meaning of the word, Mawra, which denotes meanings of spinning and shaking. Allah said,\nوَتَسِيرُ الْجِبَالُ سَيْراً\n(And Tasir the mountains will Sayr.) will fade away and become scattered particles of dust blown away by the wind,\nفَوَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ\n(Then woe that Day to those who denied), woe to them that Day as a result of Allah's torment, punishment and affliction that He will direct at them,\nالَّذِينَ هُمْ فِى خَوْضٍ يَلْعَبُونَ\n(Those who were in their falsehood, playing.) meaning, they live in this life in falsehood and make the religion the subject of their mockery and jest,\nيَوْمَ يُدَعُّونَ\n(The Day when they will be pushed down by force) meaning, they will be violently driven and shoved,\nإِلَى نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ دَعًّا\n(to the fire of Hell, with a horrible, forceful pushing.) Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi, Muhammad bin Ka`b, Ad-Dahhak, As-Suddi and Ath-Thawri said that this Ayah means, \"They will be violently shoved into the Fire.\" Allah said,\nهَـذِهِ النَّارُ الَّتِى كُنتُم بِهَا تُكَذِّبُونَ\n(This is the Fire, which you used to deny.) meaning, the angels of punishment will say these words to them, while admonishing and chastising them,\nأَفَسِحْرٌ هَـذَا أَمْ أَنتُمْ لاَ تُبْصِرُونَ اصْلَوْهَا\n(Is this magic or do you not see Enter therein) meaning, enter the Fire, `which will encircle you from every direction,'\nفَاصْبِرُواْ أَوْ لاَ تَصْبِرُواْ سَوَآءٌ عَلَيْكُمْ\n(and whether you are patient of it or impatient of it, it is all the same.) `whether you endure its torment and afflictions or not, you will never avert it or be saved from it,'\nإِنَّمَا تُجْزَوْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ\n(You are only being requited for what you used to do.) and surely, Allah is never unjust with anyone.

Sufyan Ath-Thawri, Shu`bah, and Abu Al-Ahwas, all narrated from Simak, from Khalid bin `Ar`arah, from `Ali bin Abi Talib:\nوَالسَّقْفِ الْمَرْفُوعِ\n(And by the roof raised high) \"Meaning the heaven.\" Sufyan added, \"Then `Ali recited,\nوَجَعَلْنَا السَّمَآءَ سَقْفاً مَّحْفُوظاً وَهُمْ عَنْ ءَايَـتِهَا مُعْرِضُونَ\n(And We have made the heaven a roof, safe and well-guarded. Yet they turn away from its signs.)(21:32)\" Similar was said by Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ibn Jurayj, Ibn Zayd and preferred by Ibn Jarir. The statement of Allah the Exalted,\nوَالْبَحْرِ الْمَسْجُورِ\n(And by the sea that is Masjur.) The majority say it refers to the oceans of the earth. Masjur, means, the sea will be kindled with fire on the Day of Resurrection just as Allah said in another Ayah,\nوَإِذَا الْبِحَارُ سُجِّرَتْ\n(And when the seas become as blazing fire.)(81:6) i.e., it will be kindled with fire and become a raging fire that surrounds the people in the gathering area, this was reported by Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib from `Ali bin Abi Talib. It was also reported from Ibn `Abbas, and it is the view of Sa`id bin Jubayr, Mujahid, `Abdullah bin `Ubayd bin `Umayr and others. Qatadah said, \"Masjur is the `filled sea.\"' Ibn Jarir preferred this explanation saying, \"The sea is not lit with fire now, so it is filled.\" Allah's statement;\nإِنَّ عَذَابَ رَبِّكَ لَوَاقِعٌ\n(Verily, the torment of your Lord will surely come to pass.) contains the subject of the vow, indicating that His torment will surely strike the disbelievers, as Allah stated in another Ayah;\nمَّا لَهُ مِن دَافِعٍ\n(There is none that can avert it.) indicating that when Allah decides to send the torment upon them, none can prevent it or stop it from striking them. Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Ibn Abi Ad-Dunya recorded that Ja`far bin Zayd Al-`Abdi said, \"One night, in Al-Madinah, `Umar went out investigating the welfare of Muslims and passed by the house of a man who was standing in voluntary prayer. `Umar stood quietly, listening to his recitation; the man was reciting,\nوَالطُّورِ\n(By At-Tur), until he reached the Ayah,\nإِنَّ عَذَابَ رَبِّكَ لَوَاقِعٌ - مَّا لَهُ مِن دَافِعٍ\n(Verily, the torment of your Lord will surely come to pass. There is none that can avert it.) `Umar said, `By the Lord of the Ka`bah, this is a true vow.' `Umar dismounted his donkey and sat next to a wall for a while. He then went back to his house and fell ill for a month. During his illness, the people would visit him, not knowing what caused his illness.\" May Allah be pleased with `Umar.\nDescribing the Day of Torment, the Day of Resurrection\nAllah said;\nيَوْمَ تَمُورُ السَّمَآءُ مَوْراً\n(On the Day when Tamur the heaven Mawr) Ibn `Abbas and Qatadah said: \"Shaking violently.\" Also from Ibn `Abbas, \"Split.\" Mujahid said: \"Spin violently.\" Ad-Dahhak commented on the Ayah, saying, \"The earth will violently spin and move by the command of Allah, and its areas will violently move towards each other.\" This was preferred by Ibn Jarir, because of the meaning of the word, Mawra, which denotes meanings of spinning and shaking.

Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi, Muhammad bin Ka`b, Ad-Dahhak, As-Suddi and Ath-Thawri said that this Ayah means, \"They will be violently shoved into the Fire.\" Allah said,\nهَـذِهِ النَّارُ الَّتِى كُنتُم بِهَا تُكَذِّبُونَ\n(This is the Fire, which you used to deny.) meaning, the angels of punishment will say these words to them, while admonishing and chastising them,\nأَفَسِحْرٌ هَـذَا أَمْ أَنتُمْ لاَ تُبْصِرُونَ اصْلَوْهَا\n(Is this magic or do you not see Enter therein) meaning, enter the Fire, `which will encircle you from every direction,'\nفَاصْبِرُواْ أَوْ لاَ تَصْبِرُواْ سَوَآءٌ عَلَيْكُمْ\n(and whether you are patient of it or impatient of it, it is all the same.) `whether you endure its torment and afflictions or not, you will never avert it or be saved from it,'\nإِنَّمَا تُجْزَوْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ\n(You are only being requited for what you used to do.) and surely, Allah is never unjust with anyone.

At-Tur is the mount that has trees, similar to the mount where Allah spoke to Musa, while Musa was on it, and the mount on which Allah started the prophethood of `Isa. A mount that does not have trees is called Jabal, not Tur. Allah said,</p><p>وَكِتَـبٍ مُّسْطُورٍ</p><p>(And by the Book inscribed), it is said that it means Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz, (the Preserved Table).

Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur is the Ka`bah of those who reside in the seventh heaven. During the Isra' journey, the Prophet saw Ibrahim Al-Khalil, who was reclining with his back on Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur.

Al-Bukhari recorded that Umm Salamah said, \"I complained of being ill to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and he said,\n«طُوفِي مِنْ وَرَاءِ النَّاسِ وَأَنْتِ رَاكِبَة»\n(Perform Tawaf (of the Ka`bah) behind the crowd, while you are riding.)

At-Tur is the mount that has trees, similar to the mount where Allah spoke to Musa, while Musa was on it, and the mount on which Allah started the prophethood of `Isa. A mount that does not have trees is called Jabal, not Tur. Allah said,\nوَكِتَـبٍ مُّسْطُورٍ\n(And by the Book inscribed), it is said that it means Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz, (the Preserved Table). It is also said that is refers to the divinely revealed inscribed Books that people recite, and this is why Allah said,\nفِى رَقٍّ مَّنْشُورٍ - وَالْبَيْتِ الْمَعْمُورِ\n(In parchment unrolled. And by Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur.) In the Two Sahihs it is confirmed that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said in the Hadith about Al-Isra', after ascending to the seventh heaven:\n«ثُمَّ رُفِعَ بِي إِلَى الْبَيْتِ الْمَعْمُورِ، وَإِذَا هُوَ يَدْخُلُهُ كُلَّ يَوْمٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا، لَا يَعُودُونَ إِلَيْهِ آخِرَ مَا عَلَيْهِم»\n(Then, I was taken to Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur. It is visited every day by seventy thousand angels who will not come back to visit it again.) The angels worship Allah in Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur and perform Tawaf around it just as the people of the earth perform Tawaf around the Ka`bah. Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur is the Ka`bah of those who reside in the seventh heaven. During the Isra' journey, the Prophet saw Ibrahim Al-Khalil, who was reclining with his back on Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur. It was Ibrahim who built the Ka`bah on earth, and surely, the reward is compatible with the action. Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur is parallel to the Ka`bah; every heaven has its own house of worship, which is also the direction of prayer for its residents. The house that is located in the lower heaven, is called Bayt Al-`Izzah. And Allah knows best. The statement of Allah the Exalted,\nوَالسَّقْفِ الْمَرْفُوعِ\n(And by the roof raised high.) Sufyan Ath-Thawri, Shu`bah, and Abu Al-Ahwas, all narrated from Simak, from Khalid bin `Ar`arah, from `Ali bin Abi Talib:\nوَالسَّقْفِ الْمَرْفُوعِ\n(And by the roof raised high) \"Meaning the heaven.\" Sufyan added, \"Then `Ali recited,\nوَجَعَلْنَا السَّمَآءَ سَقْفاً مَّحْفُوظاً وَهُمْ عَنْ ءَايَـتِهَا مُعْرِضُونَ\n(And We have made the heaven a roof, safe and well-guarded.

It was also reported from Ibn `Abbas, and it is the view of Sa`id bin Jubayr, Mujahid, `Abdullah bin `Ubayd bin `Umayr and others. Qatadah said, \"Masjur is the `filled sea.\"' Ibn Jarir preferred this explanation saying, \"The sea is not lit with fire now, so it is filled.\" Allah's statement;\nإِنَّ عَذَابَ رَبِّكَ لَوَاقِعٌ\n(Verily, the torment of your Lord will surely come to pass.) contains the subject of the vow, indicating that His torment will surely strike the disbelievers, as Allah stated in another Ayah;\nمَّا لَهُ مِن دَافِعٍ\n(There is none that can avert it.) indicating that when Allah decides to send the torment upon them, none can prevent it or stop it from striking them. Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Ibn Abi Ad-Dunya recorded that Ja`far bin Zayd Al-`Abdi said, \"One night, in Al-Madinah, `Umar went out investigating the welfare of Muslims and passed by the house of a man who was standing in voluntary prayer. `Umar stood quietly, listening to his recitation; the man was reciting,\nوَالطُّورِ\n(By At-Tur), until he reached the Ayah,\nإِنَّ عَذَابَ رَبِّكَ لَوَاقِعٌ - مَّا لَهُ مِن دَافِعٍ\n(Verily, the torment of your Lord will surely come to pass.

Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Ibn Abi Ad-Dunya recorded that Ja`far bin Zayd Al-`Abdi said, \"One night, in Al-Madinah, `Umar went out investigating the welfare of Muslims and passed by the house of a man who was standing in voluntary prayer. `Umar stood quietly, listening to his recitation; the man was reciting,\nوَالطُّورِ\n(By At-Tur), until he reached the Ayah,\nإِنَّ عَذَابَ رَبِّكَ لَوَاقِعٌ - مَّا لَهُ مِن دَافِعٍ\n(Verily, the torment of your Lord will surely come to pass.

The angels worship Allah in Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur and perform Tawaf around it just as the people of the earth perform Tawaf around the Ka`bah. Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur is the Ka`bah of those who reside in the seventh heaven. During the Isra' journey, the Prophet saw Ibrahim Al-Khalil, who was reclining with his back on Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur. It was Ibrahim who built the Ka`bah on earth, and surely, the reward is compatible with the action. Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur is parallel to the Ka`bah; every heaven has its own house of worship, which is also the direction of prayer for its residents. The house that is located in the lower heaven, is called Bayt Al-`Izzah. And Allah knows best. The statement of Allah the Exalted,</p><p>وَالسَّقْفِ الْمَرْفُوعِ</p><p>(And by the roof raised high.) Sufyan Ath-Thawri, Shu`bah, and Abu Al-Ahwas, all narrated from Simak, from Khalid bin `Ar`arah, from `Ali bin Abi Talib:</p><p>وَالسَّقْفِ الْمَرْفُوعِ</p><p>(And by the roof raised high) \"Meaning the heaven.\" Sufyan added, \"Then `Ali recited,</p><p>وَجَعَلْنَا السَّمَآءَ سَقْفاً مَّحْفُوظاً وَهُمْ عَنْ ءَايَـتِهَا مُعْرِضُونَ</p><p>(And We have made the heaven a roof, safe and well-guarded. Yet they turn away from its signs.)(21:32)\" Similar was said by Mujahid, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ibn Jurayj, Ibn Zayd and preferred by Ibn Jarir. The statement of Allah the Exalted,</p><p>وَالْبَحْرِ الْمَسْجُورِ</p><p>(And by the sea that is Masjur.) The majority say it refers to the oceans of the earth. Masjur, means, the sea will be kindled with fire on the Day of Resurrection just as Allah said in another Ayah,</p><p>وَإِذَا الْبِحَارُ سُجِّرَتْ</p><p>(And when the seas become as blazing fire.)(81:6) i.e., it will be kindled with fire and become a raging fire that surrounds the people in the gathering area, this was reported by Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib from `Ali bin Abi Talib. It was also reported from Ibn `Abbas, and it is the view of Sa`id bin Jubayr, Mujahid, `Abdullah bin `Ubayd bin `Umayr and others. Qatadah said, \"Masjur is the `filled sea.\"' Ibn Jarir preferred this explanation saying, \"The sea is not lit with fire now, so it is filled.\" Allah's statement;</p><p>إِنَّ عَذَابَ رَبِّكَ لَوَاقِعٌ</p><p>(Verily, the torment of your Lord will surely come to pass.) contains the subject of the vow, indicating that His torment will surely strike the disbelievers, as Allah stated in another Ayah;</p><p>مَّا لَهُ مِن دَافِعٍ</p><p>(There is none that can avert it.) indicating that when Allah decides to send the torment upon them, none can prevent it or stop it from striking them. Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr Ibn Abi Ad-Dunya recorded that Ja`far bin Zayd Al-`Abdi said, \"One night, in Al-Madinah, `Umar went out investigating the welfare of Muslims and passed by the house of a man who was standing in voluntary prayer. `Umar stood quietly, listening to his recitation; the man was reciting,</p><p>وَالطُّورِ</p><p>(By At-Tur), until he reached the Ayah,</p><p>إِنَّ عَذَابَ رَبِّكَ لَوَاقِعٌ - مَّا لَهُ مِن دَافِعٍ</p><p>(Verily, the torment of your Lord will surely come to pass. There is none that can avert it.) `Umar said, `By the Lord of the Ka`bah, this is a true vow.' `Umar dismounted his donkey and sat next to a wall for a while. He then went back to his house and fell ill for a month. During his illness, the people would visit him, not knowing what caused his illness.\" May Allah be pleased with `Umar.</p><h2>Describing the Day of Torment, the Day of Resurrection</h2><p>Allah said;</p><p>يَوْمَ تَمُورُ السَّمَآءُ مَوْراً</p><p>(On the Day when Tamur the heaven Mawr) Ibn `Abbas and Qatadah said: \"Shaking violently.\" Also from Ibn `Abbas, \"Split.\" Mujahid said: \"Spin violently.\" Ad-Dahhak commented on the Ayah, saying, \"The earth will violently spin and move by the command of Allah, and its areas will violently move towards each other.\" This was preferred by Ibn Jarir, because of the meaning of the word, Mawra, which denotes meanings of spinning and shaking. Allah said,</p><p>وَتَسِيرُ الْجِبَالُ سَيْراً</p><p>(And Tasir the mountains will Sayr.) will fade away and become scattered particles of dust blown away by the wind,</p><p>فَوَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِّلْمُكَذِّبِينَ</p><p>(Then woe that Day to those who denied), woe to them that Day as a result of Allah's torment, punishment and affliction that He will direct at them,</p><p>الَّذِينَ هُمْ فِى خَوْضٍ يَلْعَبُونَ</p><p>(Those who were in their falsehood, playing.) meaning, they live in this life in falsehood and make the religion the subject of their mockery and jest,</p><p>يَوْمَ يُدَعُّونَ</p><p>(The Day when they will be pushed down by force) meaning, they will be violently driven and shoved,</p><p>إِلَى نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ دَعًّا</p><p>(to the fire of Hell, with a horrible, forceful pushing.) Mujahid, Ash-Sha`bi, Muhammad bin Ka`b, Ad-Dahhak, As-Suddi and Ath-Thawri said that this Ayah means, \"They will be violently shoved into the Fire.\" Allah said,</p><p>هَـذِهِ النَّارُ الَّتِى كُنتُم بِهَا تُكَذِّبُونَ</p><p>(This is the Fire, which you used to deny.) meaning, the angels of punishment will say these words to them, while admonishing and chastising them,</p><p>أَفَسِحْرٌ هَـذَا أَمْ أَنتُمْ لاَ تُبْصِرُونَ اصْلَوْهَا</p><p>(Is this magic or do you not see Enter therein) meaning, enter the Fire, `which will encircle you from every direction,'</p><p>فَاصْبِرُواْ أَوْ لاَ تَصْبِرُواْ سَوَآءٌ عَلَيْكُمْ</p><p>(and whether you are patient of it or impatient of it, it is all the same.) `whether you endure its torment and afflictions or not, you will never avert it or be saved from it,'</p><p>إِنَّمَا تُجْزَوْنَ مَا كُنتُمْ تَعْمَلُونَ</p><p>(You are only being requited for what you used to do.) and surely, Allah is never unjust with anyone. Most certainly, Allah recompenses each according to their deeds.</p><p>إِنَّ الْمُتَّقِينَ فِى جَنَّـتٍ وَنَعِيمٍ - فَـكِهِينَ بِمَآ ءَاتَـهُمْ رَبُّهُمْ وَوَقَـهُمْ رَبُّهُمْ عَذَابَ الْجَحِيمِ</p>", "text_plain": "Which was revealed in Makkah\nThe Virtues of Surat At-Tur\nMalik narrated that Jubayr bin Mut`im said, \"I heard the Prophet reciting Surat At-Tur while praying Maghrib. Surely, I have never heard a more beautiful voice or recitation than his recitation.\" This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs using a chain of narration that includes Malik. Al-Bukhari recorded that Umm Salamah said, \"I complained of being ill to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and he said,\n«طُوفِي مِنْ وَرَاءِ النَّاسِ وَأَنْتِ رَاكِبَة»\n(Perform Tawaf (of the Ka`bah) behind the crowd, while you are riding.) So, I performed Tawaf while the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was praying beside the House, reciting At-Tur.\"\nبِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ\nIn the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\nAllah swears that the Coming of Torment is Near\nAllah swears by His creation, a testimony to His great ability, that His torment will surely befall His enemies; they will have no way of escaping it. At-Tur is the mount that has trees, similar to the mount where Allah spoke to Musa, while Musa was on it, and the mount on which Allah started the prophethood of `Isa. A mount that does not have trees is called Jabal, not Tur. Allah said,\nوَكِتَـبٍ مُّسْطُورٍ\n(And by the Book inscribed), it is said that it means Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz, (the Preserved Table). It is also said that is refers to the divinely revealed inscribed Books that people recite, and this is why Allah said,\nفِى رَقٍّ مَّنْشُورٍ - وَالْبَيْتِ الْمَعْمُورِ\n(In parchment unrolled. And by Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur.) In the Two Sahihs it is confirmed that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said in the Hadith about Al-Isra', after ascending to the seventh heaven:\n«ثُمَّ رُفِعَ بِي إِلَى الْبَيْتِ الْمَعْمُورِ، وَإِذَا هُوَ يَدْخُلُهُ كُلَّ يَوْمٍ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا، لَا يَعُودُونَ إِلَيْهِ آخِرَ مَا عَلَيْهِم»\n(Then, I was taken to Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur.

When the offspring of the righteous believers imitate their parents regarding faith, Allah will elevate the latter to the ranks of the former, even though the latter did not perform deeds as goodly as their parents. Allah will comfort the eyes of the parents by seeing their offspring elevated to their grades. Surely, Allah will gather them together in the best manner, and He will not decrease the reward or the grades of those higher in rank for joining them together, hence His statement,</p><p>أَلْحَقْنَا بِهِمْ ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ وَمَآ أَلَتْنَـهُمْ مِّنْ عَمَلِهِم مِّن شَىْءٍ</p><p>(to them shall We join their offspring, and We shall not decrease the reward of their deeds in anything.) Ath-Thawri reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Verily, Allah elevates the ranks of the believers' offspring to rank of their parents, even though the latter have not performed as well as the former, so that the eyes of the parents are comforted.\" Ibn `Abbas then recited this Ayah,</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَاتَّبَعَتْهُمْ ذُرِّيَّتُهُم بِإِيمَـنٍ أَلْحَقْنَا بِهِمْ ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ وَمَآ أَلَتْنَـهُمْ مِّنْ عَمَلِهِم مِّن شَىْءٍ</p><p>(And those who believe and whose offspring follow them in faith, -- to them shall We join their offspring, and We shall not decrease the reward of their deeds in anything.) Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim recorded this statement from Sufyan Ath-Thawri from Ibn `Abbas. Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah's statement,</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَاتَّبَعَتْهُمْ ذُرِّيَّتُهُم بِإِيمَـنٍ أَلْحَقْنَا بِهِمْ ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ</p><p>(And those who believe and whose offspring follow them in faith, -- to them shall We join their offspring.) saying, \"They are the offspring of the believers who died on the faith. If the ranks of their parents are higher than their ranks, they will be joined with their parents. No part of the reward their parents received for their good deeds will be reduced for them.\" `Abdullah, son of Imam Ahmad, recorded that `Ali said, \"Khadijah asked the Prophet about two of her children who died during the time of Jahiliyyah, and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said;</p><p>«هُمَا فِي النَّار»</p><p>(They are both in the Fire.) When he saw sadness on her face, he said,</p><p>«لَوْ رَأَيْتِ مَكَانَهُمَا لَأَبْغَضْتِهِمَا»</p><p>(If you saw their dwelling place, you would hate them.) She said, `O Allah's Messenger! What about my children with you.' He said,</p><p>«فِي الْجَنَّة»</p><p>(They are in Paradise.) The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَأَوْلَادَهُمْ فِي الْجَنَّةِ، وَإِنَّ الْمُشْرِكِينَ وَأَوْلَادَهُمْ فِي النَّار»</p><p>(Verily, the believers and their offspring will dwell in Paradise, while the idolators and their offspring will dwell in the Hellfire.) The Prophet then recited the Ayah,</p><p>وَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَاتَّبَعَتْهُمْ ذُرِّيَّتُهُم بِإِيمَـنٍ</p><p>(And those who believe and whose offspring follow them in faith...)\" Certainly, it is Allah's grace and favor that He grants the children this blessing because of the good deeds of their parents. He also grants His favor to parents on account of their offspring invoking Allah for them. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِنَّ اللهَ لَيَرْفَعُ الدَّرَجَةَ لِلْعَبْدِ الصَّالِحِ فِي الْجَنَّةِ فَيَقُولُ: يَا رَبِّ أَنْى لِي هذِهِ؟ فَيَقُولُ: بِاسْتِغْفَارِ وَلَدِكَ لَك»</p><p>(Verily, Allah shall elevate the grade of a righteous servant in Paradise, who will ask, \"O Lord! How did I earn this\" Allah will reply, \"Through your son's invoking Me to forgive you.\") This Hadith has an authentic chain of narration, but it was not recorded in the Sahih this way. However, there is a witnessing narration for it in Sahih Muslim, from the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah, who said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,</p><p>«إِذَا مَاتَ ابْنُ آدَمَ انْقَطَعَ عَمَلُهُ إِلَّا مِنْ ثَلَاثٍ: صَدَقَةٍ جَارِيَةٍ، أَوْ عِلْمٍ يُنْتَفَعُ بِهِ، أَوْ وَلَدٍ صَالِحٍ يَدْعُو لَه»</p><p>(When the Son of Adam dies, his record of deeds will cease except in three cases: an ongoing charity, knowledge that people are benefiting from and a righteous son who invokes Allah for him.)</p><h2>Allah is Just with the Sinners</h2><p>Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>كُلُّ امْرِىءٍ بِمَا كَسَبَ رَهَينٌ</p><p>(Every person is a pledge for that which he has earned.) After Allah mentioned His favor of elevating the offspring to the ranks of their parents, even though the deeds of the former did not qualify them, He affirmed His fairness in that, He does not punish anyone for the mistakes of others,</p><p>كُلُّ امْرِىءٍ بِمَا كَسَبَ رَهَينٌ</p><p>(Every person is a pledge for that which he has earned.) Therefore, every person will be responsible for his actions. No sin committed by others shall ever be added to one's load, even if committed by his or her parents or offspring. Allah the Exalted said,</p><p>كُلُّ نَفْسٍ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ رَهِينَةٌ - إِلاَّ أَصْحَـبَ الْيَمِينِ - فِى جَنَّـتٍ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ - عَنِ الْمُجْرِمِينَ</p><p>(Every person is a pledge for what he has earned, except those on the Right. In Gardens, they will ask one another about the criminals.)(74:38-41)</p><h2>Description of the Khamr of Paradise and the Delight of its Dwellers</h2><p>Allah said,</p><p>وَأَمْدَدْنَـهُم بِفَـكِهَةٍ وَلَحْمٍ مِّمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ</p><p>(And We shall provide them with fruit and meat such as they desire.) meaning, `We shall provide them with various types and kinds of fruits and meat, whatever they wish for and desire,'</p><p>يَتَنَـزَعُونَ فِيهَا كَأْساً</p><p>(There they shall pass from hand to hand a cup,) meaning, of wine, according to Ad-Dahhak,</p><p>لاَّ لَغْوٌ فِيهَا وَلاَ تَأْثِيمٌ</p><p>(free from any Laghw, and free from Ta'thim) meaning, when they drink, they do not say any idle, vain words or utter dirty, sinful speech like the drunken people in this life do. Ibn `Abbas said that Laghw means `falsehood' while Ta'thim means `lying'. Mujahid said, \"They do not curse each other nor sin.\" Qatadah said, \"These were the consequences of drinking in this life, and Shaytan helped in this regard. Allah purified the wine of the Hereafter from the ills and harm caused by the wine of this life.\" Therefore, Allah has purified the wine of the Hereafter from causing headaches, stomachaches and intoxication like the wine of this life. Allah stated that wine of the Hereafter shall not cause those who drink it to utter false, vain words that carry no benefit, full of foolishness and evil. Allah also described the wine of the Hereafter as beautiful in appearance, tasty and fruitful,</p><p>بَيْضَآءَ لَذَّةٍ لِّلشَّـرِبِينَ - لاَ فِيهَا غَوْلٌ وَلاَ هُمْ عَنْهَا يُنزَفُونَ</p><p>(White, delicious to the drinkers. Neither will they have Ghawl from that nor will they suffer intoxication therefrom.)(37:46-47) and,</p><p>لاَّ يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا وَلاَ يُنزِفُونَ</p><p>(Wherefrom they will get neither nay aching of the head nor any intoxication.)(56:19) Allah the Exalted said here,</p><p>يَتَنَـزَعُونَ فِيهَا كَأْساً لاَّ لَغْوٌ فِيهَا وَلاَ تَأْثِيمٌ</p><p>(There they shall pass from hand to hand a (wine) cup, free from any Laghw, and free from sin.)

When the offspring of the righteous believers imitate their parents regarding faith, Allah will elevate the latter to the ranks of the former, even though the latter did not perform deeds as goodly as their parents. Allah will comfort the eyes of the parents by seeing their offspring elevated to their grades. Surely, Allah will gather them together in the best manner, and He will not decrease the reward or the grades of those higher in rank for joining them together, hence His statement,\nأَلْحَقْنَا بِهِمْ ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ وَمَآ أَلَتْنَـهُمْ مِّنْ عَمَلِهِم مِّن شَىْءٍ\n(to them shall We join their offspring, and We shall not decrease the reward of their deeds in anything.) Ath-Thawri reported that Ibn `Abbas said, \"Verily, Allah elevates the ranks of the believers' offspring to rank of their parents, even though the latter have not performed as well as the former, so that the eyes of the parents are comforted.\" Ibn `Abbas then recited this Ayah,\nوَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَاتَّبَعَتْهُمْ ذُرِّيَّتُهُم بِإِيمَـنٍ أَلْحَقْنَا بِهِمْ ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ وَمَآ أَلَتْنَـهُمْ مِّنْ عَمَلِهِم مِّن شَىْءٍ\n(And those who believe and whose offspring follow them in faith, -- to them shall We join their offspring, and We shall not decrease the reward of their deeds in anything.) Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim recorded this statement from Sufyan Ath-Thawri from Ibn `Abbas. Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah's statement,\nوَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَاتَّبَعَتْهُمْ ذُرِّيَّتُهُم بِإِيمَـنٍ أَلْحَقْنَا بِهِمْ ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ\n(And those who believe and whose offspring follow them in faith, -- to them shall We join their offspring.) saying, \"They are the offspring of the believers who died on the faith. If the ranks of their parents are higher than their ranks, they will be joined with their parents. No part of the reward their parents received for their good deeds will be reduced for them.\" `Abdullah, son of Imam Ahmad, recorded that `Ali said, \"Khadijah asked the Prophet about two of her children who died during the time of Jahiliyyah, and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said;\n«هُمَا فِي النَّار»\n(They are both in the Fire.) When he saw sadness on her face, he said,\n«لَوْ رَأَيْتِ مَكَانَهُمَا لَأَبْغَضْتِهِمَا»\n(If you saw their dwelling place, you would hate them.) She said, `O Allah's Messenger! What about my children with you.' He said,\n«فِي الْجَنَّة»\n(They are in Paradise.) The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«إِنَّ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَأَوْلَادَهُمْ فِي الْجَنَّةِ، وَإِنَّ الْمُشْرِكِينَ وَأَوْلَادَهُمْ فِي النَّار»\n(Verily, the believers and their offspring will dwell in Paradise, while the idolators and their offspring will dwell in the Hellfire.) The Prophet then recited the Ayah,\nوَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَاتَّبَعَتْهُمْ ذُرِّيَّتُهُم بِإِيمَـنٍ\n(And those who believe and whose offspring follow them in faith...)\" Certainly, it is Allah's grace and favor that He grants the children this blessing because of the good deeds of their parents. He also grants His favor to parents on account of their offspring invoking Allah for them. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«إِنَّ اللهَ لَيَرْفَعُ الدَّرَجَةَ لِلْعَبْدِ الصَّالِحِ فِي الْجَنَّةِ فَيَقُولُ: يَا رَبِّ أَنْى لِي هذِهِ؟ فَيَقُولُ: بِاسْتِغْفَارِ وَلَدِكَ لَك»\n(Verily, Allah shall elevate the grade of a righteous servant in Paradise, who will ask, \"O Lord! How did I earn this\" Allah will reply, \"Through your son's invoking Me to forgive you.\") This Hadith has an authentic chain of narration, but it was not recorded in the Sahih this way. However, there is a witnessing narration for it in Sahih Muslim, from the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah, who said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«إِذَا مَاتَ ابْنُ آدَمَ انْقَطَعَ عَمَلُهُ إِلَّا مِنْ ثَلَاثٍ: صَدَقَةٍ جَارِيَةٍ، أَوْ عِلْمٍ يُنْتَفَعُ بِهِ، أَوْ وَلَدٍ صَالِحٍ يَدْعُو لَه»\n(When the Son of Adam dies, his record of deeds will cease except in three cases: an ongoing charity, knowledge that people are benefiting from and a righteous son who invokes Allah for him.)\nAllah is Just with the Sinners\nAllah the Exalted said,\nكُلُّ امْرِىءٍ بِمَا كَسَبَ رَهَينٌ\n(Every person is a pledge for that which he has earned.) After Allah mentioned His favor of elevating the offspring to the ranks of their parents, even though the deeds of the former did not qualify them, He affirmed His fairness in that, He does not punish anyone for the mistakes of others,\nكُلُّ امْرِىءٍ بِمَا كَسَبَ رَهَينٌ\n(Every person is a pledge for that which he has earned.) Therefore, every person will be responsible for his actions. No sin committed by others shall ever be added to one's load, even if committed by his or her parents or offspring. Allah the Exalted said,\nكُلُّ نَفْسٍ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ رَهِينَةٌ - إِلاَّ أَصْحَـبَ الْيَمِينِ - فِى جَنَّـتٍ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ - عَنِ الْمُجْرِمِينَ\n(Every person is a pledge for what he has earned, except those on the Right. In Gardens, they will ask one another about the criminals.)(74:38-41)\nDescription of the Khamr of Paradise and the Delight of its Dwellers\nAllah said,\nوَأَمْدَدْنَـهُم بِفَـكِهَةٍ وَلَحْمٍ مِّمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ\n(And We shall provide them with fruit and meat such as they desire.) meaning, `We shall provide them with various types and kinds of fruits and meat, whatever they wish for and desire,'\nيَتَنَـزَعُونَ فِيهَا كَأْساً\n(There they shall pass from hand to hand a cup,) meaning, of wine, according to Ad-Dahhak,\nلاَّ لَغْوٌ فِيهَا وَلاَ تَأْثِيمٌ\n(free from any Laghw, and free from Ta'thim) meaning, when they drink, they do not say any idle, vain words or utter dirty, sinful speech like the drunken people in this life do. Ibn `Abbas said that Laghw means `falsehood' while Ta'thim means `lying'. Mujahid said, \"They do not curse each other nor sin.\" Qatadah said, \"These were the consequences of drinking in this life, and Shaytan helped in this regard. Allah purified the wine of the Hereafter from the ills and harm caused by the wine of this life.\" Therefore, Allah has purified the wine of the Hereafter from causing headaches, stomachaches and intoxication like the wine of this life. Allah stated that wine of the Hereafter shall not cause those who drink it to utter false, vain words that carry no benefit, full of foolishness and evil. Allah also described the wine of the Hereafter as beautiful in appearance, tasty and fruitful,\nبَيْضَآءَ لَذَّةٍ لِّلشَّـرِبِينَ - لاَ فِيهَا غَوْلٌ وَلاَ هُمْ عَنْهَا يُنزَفُونَ\n(White, delicious to the drinkers. Neither will they have Ghawl from that nor will they suffer intoxication therefrom.)(37:46-47) and,\nلاَّ يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا وَلاَ يُنزِفُونَ\n(Wherefrom they will get neither nay aching of the head nor any intoxication.)(56:19) Allah the Exalted said here,\nيَتَنَـزَعُونَ فِيهَا كَأْساً لاَّ لَغْوٌ فِيهَا وَلاَ تَأْثِيمٌ\n(There they shall pass from hand to hand a (wine) cup, free from any Laghw, and free from sin.)

Ibn Abi Hatim also recorded that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah's statement,\nوَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَاتَّبَعَتْهُمْ ذُرِّيَّتُهُم بِإِيمَـنٍ أَلْحَقْنَا بِهِمْ ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ\n(And those who believe and whose offspring follow them in faith, -- to them shall We join their offspring.) saying, \"They are the offspring of the believers who died on the faith. If the ranks of their parents are higher than their ranks, they will be joined with their parents. No part of the reward their parents received for their good deeds will be reduced for them.\" `Abdullah, son of Imam Ahmad, recorded that `Ali said, \"Khadijah asked the Prophet about two of her children who died during the time of Jahiliyyah, and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said;\n«هُمَا فِي النَّار»\n(They are both in the Fire.) When he saw sadness on her face, he said,\n«لَوْ رَأَيْتِ مَكَانَهُمَا لَأَبْغَضْتِهِمَا»\n(If you saw their dwelling place, you would hate them.) She said, `O Allah's Messenger! What about my children with you.' He said,\n«فِي الْجَنَّة»\n(They are in Paradise.) The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«إِنَّ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَأَوْلَادَهُمْ فِي الْجَنَّةِ، وَإِنَّ الْمُشْرِكِينَ وَأَوْلَادَهُمْ فِي النَّار»\n(Verily, the believers and their offspring will dwell in Paradise, while the idolators and their offspring will dwell in the Hellfire.) The Prophet then recited the Ayah,\nوَالَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَاتَّبَعَتْهُمْ ذُرِّيَّتُهُم بِإِيمَـنٍ\n(And those who believe and whose offspring follow them in faith...)\" Certainly, it is Allah's grace and favor that He grants the children this blessing because of the good deeds of their parents. He also grants His favor to parents on account of their offspring invoking Allah for them. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«إِنَّ اللهَ لَيَرْفَعُ الدَّرَجَةَ لِلْعَبْدِ الصَّالِحِ فِي الْجَنَّةِ فَيَقُولُ: يَا رَبِّ أَنْى لِي هذِهِ؟ فَيَقُولُ: بِاسْتِغْفَارِ وَلَدِكَ لَك»\n(Verily, Allah shall elevate the grade of a righteous servant in Paradise, who will ask, \"O Lord! How did I earn this\" Allah will reply, \"Through your son's invoking Me to forgive you.\") This Hadith has an authentic chain of narration, but it was not recorded in the Sahih this way. However, there is a witnessing narration for it in Sahih Muslim, from the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah, who said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«إِذَا مَاتَ ابْنُ آدَمَ انْقَطَعَ عَمَلُهُ إِلَّا مِنْ ثَلَاثٍ: صَدَقَةٍ جَارِيَةٍ، أَوْ عِلْمٍ يُنْتَفَعُ بِهِ، أَوْ وَلَدٍ صَالِحٍ يَدْعُو لَه»\n(When the Son of Adam dies, his record of deeds will cease except in three cases: an ongoing charity, knowledge that people are benefiting from and a righteous son who invokes Allah for him.)\nAllah is Just with the Sinners\nAllah the Exalted said,\nكُلُّ امْرِىءٍ بِمَا كَسَبَ رَهَينٌ\n(Every person is a pledge for that which he has earned.) After Allah mentioned His favor of elevating the offspring to the ranks of their parents, even though the deeds of the former did not qualify them, He affirmed His fairness in that, He does not punish anyone for the mistakes of others,\nكُلُّ امْرِىءٍ بِمَا كَسَبَ رَهَينٌ\n(Every person is a pledge for that which he has earned.) Therefore, every person will be responsible for his actions. No sin committed by others shall ever be added to one's load, even if committed by his or her parents or offspring. Allah the Exalted said,\nكُلُّ نَفْسٍ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ رَهِينَةٌ - إِلاَّ أَصْحَـبَ الْيَمِينِ - فِى جَنَّـتٍ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ - عَنِ الْمُجْرِمِينَ\n(Every person is a pledge for what he has earned, except those on the Right. In Gardens, they will ask one another about the criminals.)(74:38-41)\nDescription of the Khamr of Paradise and the Delight of its Dwellers\nAllah said,\nوَأَمْدَدْنَـهُم بِفَـكِهَةٍ وَلَحْمٍ مِّمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ\n(And We shall provide them with fruit and meat such as they desire.) meaning, `We shall provide them with various types and kinds of fruits and meat, whatever they wish for and desire,'\nيَتَنَـزَعُونَ فِيهَا كَأْساً\n(There they shall pass from hand to hand a cup,) meaning, of wine, according to Ad-Dahhak,\nلاَّ لَغْوٌ فِيهَا وَلاَ تَأْثِيمٌ\n(free from any Laghw, and free from Ta'thim) meaning, when they drink, they do not say any idle, vain words or utter dirty, sinful speech like the drunken people in this life do. Ibn `Abbas said that Laghw means `falsehood' while Ta'thim means `lying'. Mujahid said, \"They do not curse each other nor sin.\" Qatadah said, \"These were the consequences of drinking in this life, and Shaytan helped in this regard. Allah purified the wine of the Hereafter from the ills and harm caused by the wine of this life.\" Therefore, Allah has purified the wine of the Hereafter from causing headaches, stomachaches and intoxication like the wine of this life. Allah stated that wine of the Hereafter shall not cause those who drink it to utter false, vain words that carry no benefit, full of foolishness and evil. Allah also described the wine of the Hereafter as beautiful in appearance, tasty and fruitful,\nبَيْضَآءَ لَذَّةٍ لِّلشَّـرِبِينَ - لاَ فِيهَا غَوْلٌ وَلاَ هُمْ عَنْهَا يُنزَفُونَ\n(White, delicious to the drinkers. Neither will they have Ghawl from that nor will they suffer intoxication therefrom.)(37:46-47) and,\nلاَّ يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا وَلاَ يُنزِفُونَ\n(Wherefrom they will get neither nay aching of the head nor any intoxication.)(56:19) Allah the Exalted said here,\nيَتَنَـزَعُونَ فِيهَا كَأْساً لاَّ لَغْوٌ فِيهَا وَلاَ تَأْثِيمٌ\n(There they shall pass from hand to hand a (wine) cup, free from any Laghw, and free from sin.) Allah said,\nوَيَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمْ غِلْمَانٌ لَّهُمْ كَأَنَّهُمْ لُؤْلُؤٌ مَّكْنُونٌ\n(And there will go round boy-servants of theirs to serve them as if they were preserved pearls.) This is a description of the servants and aids, the believers will have in Paradise. Their servants will be beautiful, graceful in appearance, clean and neat as well-preserved pearls,\nيَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمْ وِلْدَنٌ مُّخَلَّدُونَ - بِأَكْوَابٍ وَأَبَارِيقَ وَكَأْسٍ مِّن مَّعِينٍ\n(Immortal boys will go around them with cups, and jugs, and a glass of flowing wine.)(56:17-18) Allah the Exalted said,\nوَأَقْبَلَ بَعْضُهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ\n(And some of them draw near to others, questioning.) meaning, the believers will draw near to each other talking and remembering their actions and conditions in this life, just as people in this life talk while drinking, especially when they become intoxicated,\nقَالُواْ إِنَّا كُنَّا قَبْلُ فِى أَهْلِنَا مُشْفِقِينَ\n(Saying: \"Aforetime, we were afraid in the midst of our families.\") meaning, `in the life of world and in the midst of our families, we were afraid of our Lord and fearful of His torment and punishment,'\nفَمَنَّ اللَّهُ عَلَيْنَا وَوَقَـنَا عَذَابَ السَّمُومِ\n(So Allah has been gracious to us, and has saved us from the torment of the Fire.) meaning, `He has granted us a favor and saved us from what we feared,'\nإِنَّا كُنَّا مِن قَبْلُ نَدْعُوهُ\n(Verily, We used to invoke Him before.) meaning, `we used to invoke Him with submission and humility, and He accepted our invocation and gave us what we wished,'\nإِنَّهُ هُوَ الْبَرُّ الرَّحِيمُ\n(Verily, He is the Most Subtle, the Most Merciful.)", "verse_meta": {"id": 4757}, "text_arabic_simple": "والذين امنوا واتبعتهم ذريتهم بايمان الحقنا بهم ذريتهم وما التناهم من عملهم من شيء كل امري بما كسب رهين ٢١ وامددناهم بفاكهة ولحم مما يشتهون ٢٢ يتنازعون فيها كاسا لا لغو فيها ولا تاثيم ٢٣ ۞ ويطوف عليهم غلمان لهم كانهم لولو مكنون ٢٤ واقبل بعضهم على بعض يتساءلون ٢٥ قالوا انا كنا قبل في اهلنا مشفقين ٢٦ فمن الله علينا ووقانا عذاب السموم ٢٧ انا كنا من قبل ندعوه انه هو البر الرحيم ٢٨وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَٱتَّبَعَتْهُمْ ذُرِّيَّتُهُم بِإِيمَـٰنٍ أَلْحَقْنَا بِهِمْ ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ وَمَآ أَلَتْنَـٰهُم مِّنْ عَمَلِهِم مِّن شَىْءٍۢ ۚ كُلُّ ٱمْرِئٍۭ بِمَا كَسَبَ رَهِينٌۭ ٢١ وَأَمْدَدْنَـٰهُم بِفَـٰكِهَةٍۢ وَلَحْمٍۢ مِّمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ ٢٢ يَتَنَـٰزَعُونَ فِيهَا كَأْسًۭا لَّا لَغْوٌۭ فِيهَا وَلَا تَأْثِيمٌۭ ٢٣ ۞ وَيَطُوفُ عَلَيْهِمْ غِلْمَانٌۭ لَّهُمْ كَأَنَّهُمْ لُؤْلُؤٌۭ مَّكْنُونٌۭ ٢٤ وَأَقْبَلَ بَعْضُهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍۢ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ ٢٥ قَالُوٓا۟ إِنَّا كُنَّا قَبْلُ فِىٓ أَهْلِنَا مُشْفِقِينَ ٢٦ فَمَنَّ ٱللَّهُ عَلَيْنَا وَوَقَىٰنَا عَذَابَ ٱلسَّمُومِ ٢٧ إِنَّا كُنَّا مِن قَبْلُ نَدْعُوهُ ۖ إِنَّهُۥ هُوَ ٱلْبَرُّ ٱلرَّحِيمُ", "text_arabic_uthmani": "والذين امنوا واتبعتهم ذريتهم بايمان الحقنا بهم ذريتهم وما التناهم من عملهم من شيء كل امري بما كسب رهين ٢١ وامددناهم بفاكهة ولحم مما يشتهون ٢٢ يتنازعون فيها كاسا لا لغو فيها ولا تاثيم ٢٣ ۞ ويطوف عليهم غلمان لهم كانهم لولو مكنون ٢٤ واقبل بعضهم على بعض يتساءلون ٢٥ قالوا انا كنا قبل في اهلنا مشفقين ٢٦ فمن الله علينا ووقانا عذاب السموم ٢٧ انا كنا من قبل ندعوه انه هو البر الرحيم", "fetched_at": 1761804907.777445}

However, there is a witnessing narration for it in Sahih Muslim, from the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah, who said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«إِذَا مَاتَ ابْنُ آدَمَ انْقَطَعَ عَمَلُهُ إِلَّا مِنْ ثَلَاثٍ: صَدَقَةٍ جَارِيَةٍ، أَوْ عِلْمٍ يُنْتَفَعُ بِهِ، أَوْ وَلَدٍ صَالِحٍ يَدْعُو لَه»\n(When the Son of Adam dies, his record of deeds will cease except in three cases: an ongoing charity, knowledge that people are benefiting from and a righteous son who invokes Allah for him.)\nAllah is Just with the Sinners\nAllah the Exalted said,\nكُلُّ امْرِىءٍ بِمَا كَسَبَ رَهَينٌ\n(Every person is a pledge for that which he has earned.) After Allah mentioned His favor of elevating the offspring to the ranks of their parents, even though the deeds of the former did not qualify them, He affirmed His fairness in that, He does not punish anyone for the mistakes of others,\nكُلُّ امْرِىءٍ بِمَا كَسَبَ رَهَينٌ\n(Every person is a pledge for that which he has earned.) Therefore, every person will be responsible for his actions. No sin committed by others shall ever be added to one's load, even if committed by his or her parents or offspring. Allah the Exalted said,\nكُلُّ نَفْسٍ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ رَهِينَةٌ - إِلاَّ أَصْحَـبَ الْيَمِينِ - فِى جَنَّـتٍ يَتَسَآءَلُونَ - عَنِ الْمُجْرِمِينَ\n(Every person is a pledge for what he has earned, except those on the Right. In Gardens, they will ask one another about the criminals.)(74:38-41)\nDescription of the Khamr of Paradise and the Delight of its Dwellers\nAllah said,\nوَأَمْدَدْنَـهُم بِفَـكِهَةٍ وَلَحْمٍ مِّمَّا يَشْتَهُونَ\n(And We shall provide them with fruit and meat such as they desire.) meaning, `We shall provide them with various types and kinds of fruits and meat, whatever they wish for and desire,'\nيَتَنَـزَعُونَ فِيهَا كَأْساً\n(There they shall pass from hand to hand a cup,) meaning, of wine, according to Ad-Dahhak,\nلاَّ لَغْوٌ فِيهَا وَلاَ تَأْثِيمٌ\n(free from any Laghw, and free from Ta'thim) meaning, when they drink, they do not say any idle, vain words or utter dirty, sinful speech like the drunken people in this life do. Ibn `Abbas said that Laghw means `falsehood' while Ta'thim means `lying'. Mujahid said, \"They do not curse each other nor sin.\" Qatadah said, \"These were the consequences of drinking in this life, and Shaytan helped in this regard. Allah purified the wine of the Hereafter from the ills and harm caused by the wine of this life.\" Therefore, Allah has purified the wine of the Hereafter from causing headaches, stomachaches and intoxication like the wine of this life. Allah stated that wine of the Hereafter shall not cause those who drink it to utter false, vain words that carry no benefit, full of foolishness and evil. Allah also described the wine of the Hereafter as beautiful in appearance, tasty and fruitful,\nبَيْضَآءَ لَذَّةٍ لِّلشَّـرِبِينَ - لاَ فِيهَا غَوْلٌ وَلاَ هُمْ عَنْهَا يُنزَفُونَ\n(White, delicious to the drinkers. Neither will they have Ghawl from that nor will they suffer intoxication therefrom.)(37:46-47) and,\nلاَّ يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا وَلاَ يُنزِفُونَ\n(Wherefrom they will get neither nay aching of the head nor any intoxication.)(56:19) Allah the Exalted said here,\nيَتَنَـزَعُونَ فِيهَا كَأْساً لاَّ لَغْوٌ فِيهَا وَلاَ تَأْثِيمٌ\n(There they shall pass from hand to hand a (wine) cup, free from any Laghw, and free from sin.)

Mujahid said, \"They do not curse each other nor sin.\" Qatadah said, \"These were the consequences of drinking in this life, and Shaytan helped in this regard.

Allah also described the wine of the Hereafter as beautiful in appearance, tasty and fruitful,</p><p>بَيْضَآءَ لَذَّةٍ لِّلشَّـرِبِينَ - لاَ فِيهَا غَوْلٌ وَلاَ هُمْ عَنْهَا يُنزَفُونَ</p><p>(White, delicious to the drinkers.

Mujahid said, \"They do not curse each other nor sin.\" Qatadah said, \"These were the consequences of drinking in this life, and Shaytan helped in this regard.

Allah also described the wine of the Hereafter as beautiful in appearance, tasty and fruitful,</p><p>بَيْضَآءَ لَذَّةٍ لِّلشَّـرِبِينَ - لاَ فِيهَا غَوْلٌ وَلاَ هُمْ عَنْهَا يُنزَفُونَ</p><p>(White, delicious to the drinkers.

Mujahid said, \"They do not curse each other nor sin.\" Qatadah said, \"These were the consequences of drinking in this life, and Shaytan helped in this regard.

Allah also described the wine of the Hereafter as beautiful in appearance, tasty and fruitful,</p><p>بَيْضَآءَ لَذَّةٍ لِّلشَّـرِبِينَ - لاَ فِيهَا غَوْلٌ وَلاَ هُمْ عَنْهَا يُنزَفُونَ</p><p>(White, delicious to the drinkers.

Allah the Exalted said in other Ayat,\nوَلَوْ فَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِم بَاباً مِّنَ السَّمَاءِ فَظَلُّواْ فِيهِ يَعْرُجُونَ - لَقَالُواْ إِنَّمَا سُكِّرَتْ أَبْصَـرُنَا بَلْ نَحْنُ قَوْمٌ مَّسْحُورُونَ\n(And even if We opened to them a gate from the heaven and they were to keep on ascending thereto (all day long), they would surely say (in the evening): \"Our eyes have been dazzled.

Allah the Exalted said,\nوَإِنَّ لِلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ عَذَاباً دُونَ ذَلِكَ\n(And verily, for those who do wrong, there is another punishment before this;) meaning, that of being the torment in this world. Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,\nوَلَنُذِيقَنَّهُمْ مِّنَ الْعَذَابِ الاٌّدْنَى دُونَ الْعَذَابِ الاٌّكْبَرِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ\n(And verily, We will make them taste of the near torment prior to the supreme torment (in the Hereafter), in order that they may return.)(32:21) Allah said;\nوَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ\n(but most of them know not.) meaning, `We will torment them in the life of the world and test them with various hardships, so that they might go back and repent. However, they do not understand what is happening to them or why, because when the torment is removed, they revert to committing the worst of what they used to do before.' A Hadith states that,\nOrdering the Prophet to have Patience and to glorify Allah\nAllah the Exalted said,\nوَاصْبِرْ لِحُكْمِ رَبِّكَ فَإِنَّكَ بِأَعْيُنِنَا\n(So wait patiently for the decision of your Lord, for verily, you are under Our Eyes;) meaning, `be patient in the face of their annoyance and do not be concerned about it, for you are under Our Eyes and Protection, and We will surely protect you from the people,'\nوَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ\n(and glorify the praises of your Lord when you get up.) Ad-Dahhak said, \"Meaning to stand for the Salah (and say): \"Glorious are You and with Your praise, Hallowed be Your Name, Exalted be Your majesty, and there is no God (worthy of worship) except You.\" In his Sahih, Muslim recorded that `Umar used to recite this supplication when he began Salah. Ahmad and the Sunan compilers recorded this Hadith from Abu Sa`id and other Companions, who stated that the Prophet used to say that. Abu Al-Jawza' commented on the Ayah;\nوَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ\n(and glorify the praises of your Lord when you get up.) \"From your sleep, from your bed.\" And this is the view chosen by Ibn Jarir. Suporting this view is the Hadith that Imam Ahmad recorded that `Ubadah bin As-Samit said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«مَنْ تَعَارَّ مِنَ اللَّيْلِ فَقَالَ: لَا إِلهَ إِلَّا اللهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ، لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ، وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ، سُبْحَانَ اللهِ وَالْحَمْدُ للهِ وَلَا إِلهَ إِلَّا اللهُ وَاللهُ أَكْبَرُ، وَلَا حَوْلَ وَلَا قُوَّةَ إِلَّا بِاللهِ. ثُمَّ قَالَ: رَبِّ اغْفِرْ لِي أو قال: ثُمَّ دَعَا اسْتُجِيبَ لَهُ، فَإِنْ عَزَمَ فَتَوَضَّأَ ثُمَّ صَلَّى، قُبِلَتْ صَلَاتُه»\n(Whoever gets up at night and says: `La ilaha illallah, He is One without partners. For Him is the kingdom and all praise is due to Him. He has power over all things. Glory be to Allah, and all praise is due to Allah, and La illaha illallah and Allah is Greater. There is neither might nor power except Allah.' And then says, `O Lord! Forgive me.' Or invokes (Allah), he will be responded to it, and if he intends and performs ablution and prays, his prayer will be accepted.) Al-Bukhari and the Sunan compilers also recorded this Hadith. Ibn Abi Najih reported that Mujahid commented on the Ayah,\nوَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ\n(and glorify the praises of your Lord when you get up.) saying, \"From every gathering you sit in.\" Ath-Thawri said that Abu Ishaq narrated that Abu Al-Ahwas said that,\nوَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ\n(and glorify the praises of your Lord when you get up.) \"When a person wants to stand from a gathering, he says: `Glory be to You, O Allah, and with Your praise.\"' Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet said,\n«مَنْ جَلَسَ فِي مَجْلِسٍ فَكَثُرَ فِيهِ لَغَطُهُ، فَقَالَ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَقُومَ مِنْ مَجْلِسِهِ: سُبْحَانَكَ اللْهُمَّ وَبِحَمْدِكَ، أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلهَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ، أَسْتَغْفِرُكَ وَأَتُوبُ إِلَيْكَ، إِلَّا غَفَرَ اللهُ لَهُ مَا كَانَ فِي مَجْلِسِهِ ذلِك»\n(Whoever sits in a gathering in which he speaks idle excessively, but says before he stands up to depart that gathering, `Glory be to You O Allah , and with Your praise, I testify that there is no God (worthy of worship) except You, I seek Your forgiveness, and I repent to You.' Then, Allah will forgive him what he has said in that gathering.) This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi, and this is his wording, and it was also recorded by An-Nasa'i in `Amal Al-Yawm wal-Laylah. At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Sahih.\" It was also recorded by Al-Hakim in his Mustadrak, and he said, \"Its chain meets the criteria of Muslim.\" Allah the Exalted said;\nوَمِنَ الَّيْلِ فَسَبِّحْهُ\n(And in the nighttime also glorify His praises), meaning remember and worship Allah by reciting the Qur'an and praying at night. Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,\nوَمِنَ الَّيْلِ فَتَهَجَّدْ بِهِ نَافِلَةً لَّكَ عَسَى أَن يَبْعَثَكَ رَبُّكَ مَقَاماً مَّحْمُودًا\n(And in some of the night, offer Tahajjud in it as an additional (prayer) for you. It may be that your Lord will raise you to Maqam Mahmud.)(17:79) Allah said;\nوَإِدْبَـرَ النُّجُومِ\n(and at the setting of the stars.) is in reference to the two voluntary Rak`ahs before the Dawn prayer, according to a Hadith from Ibn `Abbas.

These two Rak`ahs are an established Sunnah performed before the stars are about to set. It is confimred in the Two Sahihs from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, who said, \"The Prophet was never more regular and particular in offering any voluntary prayer than the two (Sunnah) Rak`ahs of the Fajr prayer.\" In another narration collected by Muslim, the Prophet said,</p><p>«رَكْعَتَا الْفَجْرِ خَيْرٌ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا وَمَا فِيهَا»</p><p>(Two (Sunnah) Rak`ahs before Fajr are better than this life and all that in it.)This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat At-Tur, all praise and gratitude is due to Allah.</p>", "text_plain": "The Stubbornness of the Idolators; Their Punishment\nAllah the Exalted reaffirms the stubbornness of the idolators and their ignorance of what goes around them,\nوَإِن يَرَوْاْ كِسْفاً مِّنَ السَّمَآءِ سَـقِطاً\n(And if they were to see a piece of the heaven falling down,) meaning, on them as punishment, they would not believe it is coming their way, saying that, these are layers of clouds on top of each other. Allah the Exalted said in other Ayat,\nوَلَوْ فَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِم بَاباً مِّنَ السَّمَاءِ فَظَلُّواْ فِيهِ يَعْرُجُونَ - لَقَالُواْ إِنَّمَا سُكِّرَتْ أَبْصَـرُنَا بَلْ نَحْنُ قَوْمٌ مَّسْحُورُونَ\n(And even if We opened to them a gate from the heaven and they were to keep on ascending thereto (all day long), they would surely say (in the evening): \"Our eyes have been dazzled. Nay, we are a people bewitched.\")(15:14-15) Allah the Exalted said,\nفَذَرْهُمْ\n(So leave them alone), `O Muhammad,'\nحَتَّى يُلَـقُواْ يَوْمَهُمُ الَّذِى فِيهِ يُصْعَقُونَ\n(till they meet their Day, in which they will sink into a fainting.) on the Day of Resurrection,\nيَوْمَ لاَ يُغْنِى عَنْهُمْ كَيْدُهُمْ شَيْئاً\n(The Day when their plotting shall not avail them at all, ) meaning, on the Day of Resurrection, their deceit and plots they planned in this life shall not help them in the least,\nوَلاَ هُمْ يُنصَرُونَ\n(nor will they be helped.) Allah the Exalted said,\nوَإِنَّ لِلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ عَذَاباً دُونَ ذَلِكَ\n(And verily, for those who do wrong, there is another punishment before this;) meaning, that of being the torment in this world. Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,\nوَلَنُذِيقَنَّهُمْ مِّنَ الْعَذَابِ الاٌّدْنَى دُونَ الْعَذَابِ الاٌّكْبَرِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ\n(And verily, We will make them taste of the near torment prior to the supreme torment (in the Hereafter), in order that they may return.)(32:21) Allah said;\nوَلَـكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لاَ يَعْلَمُونَ\n(but most of them know not.) meaning, `We will torment them in the life of the world and test them with various hardships, so that they might go back and repent. However, they do not understand what is happening to them or why, because when the torment is removed, they revert to committing the worst of what they used to do before.' A Hadith states that,\nOrdering the Prophet to have Patience and to glorify Allah\nAllah the Exalted said,\nوَاصْبِرْ لِحُكْمِ رَبِّكَ فَإِنَّكَ بِأَعْيُنِنَا\n(So wait patiently for the decision of your Lord, for verily, you are under Our Eyes;) meaning, `be patient in the face of their annoyance and do not be concerned about it, for you are under Our Eyes and Protection, and We will surely protect you from the people,'\nوَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ\n(and glorify the praises of your Lord when you get up.) Ad-Dahhak said, \"Meaning to stand for the Salah (and say): \"Glorious are You and with Your praise, Hallowed be Your Name, Exalted be Your majesty, and there is no God (worthy of worship) except You.\" In his Sahih, Muslim recorded that `Umar used to recite this supplication when he began Salah. Ahmad and the Sunan compilers recorded this Hadith from Abu Sa`id and other Companions, who stated that the Prophet used to say that. Abu Al-Jawza' commented on the Ayah;\nوَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ\n(and glorify the praises of your Lord when you get up.) \"From your sleep, from your bed.\" And this is the view chosen by Ibn Jarir. Suporting this view is the Hadith that Imam Ahmad recorded that `Ubadah bin As-Samit said that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said,\n«مَنْ تَعَارَّ مِنَ اللَّيْلِ فَقَالَ: لَا إِلهَ إِلَّا اللهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ، لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ، وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ، سُبْحَانَ اللهِ وَالْحَمْدُ للهِ وَلَا إِلهَ إِلَّا اللهُ وَاللهُ أَكْبَرُ، وَلَا حَوْلَ وَلَا قُوَّةَ إِلَّا بِاللهِ. ثُمَّ قَالَ: رَبِّ اغْفِرْ لِي أو قال: ثُمَّ دَعَا اسْتُجِيبَ لَهُ، فَإِنْ عَزَمَ فَتَوَضَّأَ ثُمَّ صَلَّى، قُبِلَتْ صَلَاتُه»\n(Whoever gets up at night and says: `La ilaha illallah, He is One without partners. For Him is the kingdom and all praise is due to Him. He has power over all things. Glory be to Allah, and all praise is due to Allah, and La illaha illallah and Allah is Greater. There is neither might nor power except Allah.' And then says, `O Lord! Forgive me.' Or invokes (Allah), he will be responded to it, and if he intends and performs ablution and prays, his prayer will be accepted.) Al-Bukhari and the Sunan compilers also recorded this Hadith. Ibn Abi Najih reported that Mujahid commented on the Ayah,\nوَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ\n(and glorify the praises of your Lord when you get up.) saying, \"From every gathering you sit in.\" Ath-Thawri said that Abu Ishaq narrated that Abu Al-Ahwas said that,\nوَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ\n(and glorify the praises of your Lord when you get up.) \"When a person wants to stand from a gathering, he says: `Glory be to You, O Allah, and with Your praise.\"' Abu Hurayrah narrated that the Prophet said,\n«مَنْ جَلَسَ فِي مَجْلِسٍ فَكَثُرَ فِيهِ لَغَطُهُ، فَقَالَ قَبْلَ أَنْ يَقُومَ مِنْ مَجْلِسِهِ: سُبْحَانَكَ اللْهُمَّ وَبِحَمْدِكَ، أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلهَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ، أَسْتَغْفِرُكَ وَأَتُوبُ إِلَيْكَ، إِلَّا غَفَرَ اللهُ لَهُ مَا كَانَ فِي مَجْلِسِهِ ذلِك»\n(Whoever sits in a gathering in which he speaks idle excessively, but says before he stands up to depart that gathering, `Glory be to You O Allah , and with Your praise, I testify that there is no God (worthy of worship) except You, I seek Your forgiveness, and I repent to You.' Then, Allah will forgive him what he has said in that gathering.) This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi, and this is his wording, and it was also recorded by An-Nasa'i in `Amal Al-Yawm wal-Laylah. At-Tirmidhi said, \"Hasan Sahih.\" It was also recorded by Al-Hakim in his Mustadrak, and he said, \"Its chain meets the criteria of Muslim.\" Allah the Exalted said;\nوَمِنَ الَّيْلِ فَسَبِّحْهُ\n(And in the nighttime also glorify His praises), meaning remember and worship Allah by reciting the Qur'an and praying at night. Allah the Exalted said in another Ayah,\nوَمِنَ الَّيْلِ فَتَهَجَّدْ بِهِ نَافِلَةً لَّكَ عَسَى أَن يَبْعَثَكَ رَبُّكَ مَقَاماً مَّحْمُودًا\n(And in some of the night, offer Tahajjud in it as an additional (prayer) for you. It may be that your Lord will raise you to Maqam Mahmud.)(17:79) Allah said;\nوَإِدْبَـرَ النُّجُومِ\n(and at the setting of the stars.) is in reference to the two voluntary Rak`ahs before the Dawn prayer, according to a Hadith from Ibn `Abbas. These two Rak`ahs are an established Sunnah performed before the stars are about to set. It is confimred in the Two Sahihs from `A'ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, who said, \"The Prophet was never more regular and particular in offering any voluntary prayer than the two (Sunnah) Rak`ahs of the Fajr prayer.\" In another narration collected by Muslim, the Prophet said,\n«رَكْعَتَا الْفَجْرِ خَيْرٌ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا وَمَا فِيهَا»\n(Two (Sunnah) Rak`ahs before Fajr are better than this life and all that in it.)This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat At-Tur, all praise and gratitude is due to Allah.", "verse_meta": {"id": 4784}, "text_arabic_simple": "وان يروا كسفا من السماء ساقطا يقولوا سحاب مركوم ٤٤ فذرهم حتى يلاقوا يومهم الذي فيه يصعقون ٤٥ يوم لا يغني عنهم كيدهم شييا ولا هم ينصرون ٤٦ وان للذين ظلموا عذابا دون ذالك ولاكن اكثرهم لا يعلمون ٤٧ واصبر لحكم ربك فانك باعيننا وسبح بحمد ربك حين تقوم ٤٨ ومن الليل فسبحه وادبار النجوم ٤٩وَإِن يَرَوْا۟ كِسْفًۭا مِّنَ ٱلسَّمَآءِ سَاقِطًۭا يَقُولُوا۟ سَحَابٌۭ مَّرْكُومٌۭ ٤٤ فَذَرْهُمْ حَتَّىٰ يُلَـٰقُوا۟ يَوْمَهُمُ ٱلَّذِى فِيهِ يُصْعَقُونَ ٤٥ يَوْمَ لَا يُغْنِى عَنْهُمْ كَيْدُهُمْ شَيْـًۭٔا وَلَا هُمْ يُنصَرُونَ ٤٦ وَإِنَّ لِلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا۟ عَذَابًۭا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ وَلَـٰكِنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ ٤٧ وَٱصْبِرْ لِحُكْمِ رَبِّكَ فَإِنَّكَ بِأَعْيُنِنَا ۖ وَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ حِينَ تَقُومُ ٤٨ وَمِنَ ٱلَّيْلِ فَسَبِّحْهُ وَإِدْبَـٰرَ ٱلنُّجُومِ", "text_arabic_uthmani": "وان يروا كسفا من السماء ساقطا يقولوا سحاب مركوم ٤٤ فذرهم حتى يلاقوا يومهم الذي فيه يصعقون ٤٥ يوم لا يغني عنهم كيدهم شييا ولا هم ينصرون ٤٦ وان للذين ظلموا عذابا دون ذالك ولاكن اكثرهم لا يعلمون ٤٧ واصبر لحكم ربك فانك باعيننا وسبح بحمد ربك حين تقوم ٤٨ ومن الليل فسبحه وادبار النجوم", "fetched_at": 1761804946.824286}
