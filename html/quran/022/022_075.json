And to Allah return all matters.) He knows what will happen to His Messengers and the Message He sent them with, for none of their affairs are hidden from Him. He says:</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">عَـلِمُ الْغَيْبِ فَلاَ يُظْهِرُ عَلَى غَيْبِهِ أَحَداً </div><p>(\"The All-Knower of the Ghayb (Unseen), and He reveals to none His Ghayb.\")72:26 until His saying;</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">وَأَحْصَى كُلَّ شَىْءٍ عَدَداً</div><p>(and He keeps count of all things.) 72:28 So He, may He be glorified, is guarding them, and is Witness to what is said about them. He is protecting them and supporting them.</p><div class=\"arabic uthmani\">يَـأَيُّهَا الرَّسُولُ بَلِّغْ مَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ مِن رَّبِّكَ وَإِن لَّمْ تَفْعَلْ فَمَا بَلَّغْتَ رِسَالَتَهُ وَاللَّهُ يَعْصِمُكَ مِنَ النَّاسِ</div><p>(O Messenger! Proclaim which has been sent down to you from your Lord. And if you do not, then you have not conveyed His Message. Allah will protect you from mankind) 5:67.</p>"
